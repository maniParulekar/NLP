Since 'H' of \"Hello\" is in upper case in this sentence and also \"Hello\" is followed by a noun, this tagger tags Hello as noun. If the sentence has 'H' of \"Hello\" in lower case, it will recognize it as Adjective since it is followed by a noun \"world\". To prove that this tagger tags interjections as adjective or adposition, I ran the tagger on a different sentence \"Oops I did it again\" which starts with Interjection \"Oops\". In this case, the tagger tags \"Oops\" as Adposition since it is followed by a pronoun in this sentence. "

    "<font color=blue> 2. Run a different POS tagger in Python. Process the same two sentences from question 1.\n",
    "a.\tDoes it produce the same or different output?\n",
    "b.\tExplain any differences as best you can\n",
    " </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, it does produce different results for the both sentences long and short with two different tagging methods. Pattern library tag function use Penn treebank tag set which more refined tagging method over Universal tag set from NLTK library. Penn treebank improves POS tagging of sentences by adding more specific tag categories for part of speech. For eg: \"defining\" from the long sentence is tagged as 'verb' by Universal tag set and it is tagged as 'verb gerand' by Penn tree bank. In case of \"McConnel's\" from Long sentence, the apostrophe 's' forming possessive nouns are categorized with specific POS tag catergory of 'POS' (Possessive ending) in Penn whereas it is tagged as 'PRT' which is 'particle' instead of a more elaborate \"Particle possesive\" by Universal. Pronouns like \"its\" tagged as 'PRPS' (Possessive pronoun) in Penn and as Pron in Universal. \"to\" is categoried as 'TO' by Penn and as 'PRT' in Universal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though, parts of speech tagging can be important for syntactic and semantic analysis, I noticed that the POS tagging is **not always correct** by both methods.  In case of Long sentence, the universal tagger tags \"bar\" as verb which is correct, but the Penn treebank tagger tags \"bar\" as \"Noun\" which is incorrect. In case of short sentences, Penn treebank tagger tags \"Oops\" or \"Hello\" correctly as Interjection whereas Universal tagger tags them incorrect as Noun . I think one of the differnce we see between two tagger is due to the fact that one tagger is more generalized than the other. But, there are differnces in tagging between these two taggers which cannot be explained even if we notice that both the tagger take the preceding word and succceeding word tag analysis into account while tagging the words of a sentence. **Overall, both tagging sets are not perfect but the Penn POS tagger does yield pretty accurate and precise results**.

One of the reason for matching tagging with mine and Pattern tagger is that the tag set utilized for tagging is same. I think I will choose Penn tree tag set taggers for POS tagging task more than any other tagger in future since Penn tree tag set encompasses appropriate Part-Of-Speech for English language.\n",

    "As we observed earlier with long and short sentence tagging, Universal tag set **mark core part of speech categories** most of the time correctly. To **distinguish additional lexical and grammatical properties of words**, I would use the Pattern Penn tagger. In case of news article sentence too, we observed the same differences in tagging as earlier mentioned in the answser to question 2 above. For eg: \"as\" is tagged 'IN' in Penn and as ADP in Universal, \"House\" is tagged NNP in Penn and as Noun in Universal, \"bills\" as NNS in Penn and as Noun in Universal."
