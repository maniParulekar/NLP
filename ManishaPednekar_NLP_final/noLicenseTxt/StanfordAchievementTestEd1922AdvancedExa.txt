   come and get the..............

 2 A kitten can climb a tree, but a dog cannot. This is very lucky for
   Nellie's kitten. Every time Joe's big dog comes along the kitten climbs
   a tree and the............. cannot follow.

 3 Anna had never seen a squirrel in her life, although she had always
   wanted to very much. One day when she was playing under a tree she
   heard a funny little noise over her head. She looked up, and what do
   you think she saw? Up there in the............. was the very thing she
   had always wanted to see, a..............

 5 One day when Jane was sweeping she found a dime on the floor under the
   bed. They could not find out whose dime it was, so Jane's mother gave
   it to her. Now, every time Jane............. the floor she looks
   carefully under the bed for another..............

 6 Helen and Kate pulled their sled through the deep snow to the top of the
   hill and soon were coasting swiftly down again. They did this over and
   over. The............. was so deep that they found it hard work to
   drag the............. to the top.

 7 Once a black raven wanted to have white feathers like a swan. The raven
   saw that the swan lived in the water, and thought it was the water that
   made the swan's feathers so white. So the............. decided to wash
   his feathers every day to see if it would not make them..............

 8 Birds' eggs are almost as different from each other as are the birds
   themselves. The robin lays four or five blue eggs. The dove lays two
   white eggs. The sparrow lays six or eight speckled eggs. If we should
   find a nest with four blue eggs in it, we could be pretty sure that it
   was the nest of a............. rather than of a............. or dove.

 9 Once there lived on a mountain near a village an immense giant whose
   cruelty kept the people of the village in great terror. However, there
   was one person in the village who was not afraid of the giant. This was
   a young soldier who carried a magic sword that a fairy had given him.
   Once when the............. came down from the............. the

10 Once a hen was so foolish as to go to a fox and ask him to look after
   her chicks while she went to the barnyard to find some worms for her
   chicks. The fox was of course quite willing. The hen was gone a long
   time. When she finally returned, she found that the fox had eaten all

11 When the bear appeared near the hut, Walter was alone. His father had

12 In a certain village a ton of coal costs just as much as a cord of

13 "Come on" called Joe, "let's go for a swim down by Jones' Point, where
   the river is deep." "No," said Pete, "let's swim down by Duggan's.

   you want to go to............., but because you can't swim," said
   ..............

14 Richard and Miss Cabot quickly found their way alone to the house of
   Mr. Smith on Craven Street. Miss Cabot left Richard in the carriage,
   walked quickly to the door, and sending up her card by the servant,
   requested to see Mr. Smith. The............. soon returned and begged
   her to come in. As soon as she had done so. Miss Cabot introduced
   herself to Mr.............. and begged him to come out and talk with
   ............., who was waiting outside in the carriage.

15 Joe made up a game which he called "Jac-alack." One person called Jack
   must climb a tree and hang by his arms from a low bough. The others
   stand behind him and say in unison, "Alas, alack, he fell on his back,"
   and while they are saying it, one of them hits Jack with a bean bag. If
   Jack can see or guess who did it, he may drop down, and the guilty
   person takes his place. Otherwise he has to............. there for
   another turn and sing out, "Alas, alack, another whack." It is quite a
   game and Jack must have strong..............

16 It is well established that the bee, which is commonly supposed to be
   so industrious, really works only two or three hours a day. The man who
   works eight or ten hours a day is therefore far more............. than
   the..............

17 Boys and girls know my name. And mothers and fathers, too. Big folks
   love me. You do, too. The first letters in the first four sentences of
   this paragraph spell my name; so write it here..............

18 Energy is a measure of the fullness of life and is indispensable for
   genius. No energy at all is death. Idiots are feeble and listless.
   Nearly all the leaders of mankind have been noted for their remarkable
   ..............

19 Deciduous trees lose their leaves in winter, while evergreens, as their
   name implies, do not. Therefore, in forests composed of.............
   trees the ground is less shaded in winter than is the case in forests
   whose trees are..............

20 Some historians believe that the spread of anti-slavery feeling among
   the people of the North previous to the Civil War was due less to the
   moral issue involved than to the fact that they recognized the system
   of............. as a menace to the industrial system of free labor.

21 If I were writing about the rich, I should be inclined to divide them,
   according to their attitude toward life, into workers and parasites.
   The motto of the worker is, "I owe the world a life," and the motto of
   the.................. is, "The.................. owes me a living."

22 Caution, when not present in excess, is a desirable trait. Often it
   saves one from disappointment or failure. Occasionally, however, one
   finds a person so extremely.................. that his will is
   paralyzed and he is totally unable to set about any new undertaking.
   Too much.................. is indeed often.................. than too
   little.

23 A whale is not a fish, even though it does live in water. A fish has no
   lungs, is cold-blooded, and absorbs oxygen from the water through its
   gills; but a whale is warm-blooded and has a genuine set of lungs. In
   consequence, in bodily structure the is.................. like a
   shark, which is a true fish, than it is like a horse.

24 The brook on our farm has many whims. It ripples over bright and shiny
   rocks, and falls into a placid little pool so clear that I can see the
   pebbles on the bottom and can see myself down there, too. As I look
   straight down, it is hard to tell whether what I see is my nose or a
   .................., but as I move a little, that which I sec stands
   still, so I know it is not.....................................
   Farther on the brook forgets the placid pool and tumbles over roots and
   rocks. It does, indeed, have many...................

25 To pant for recognition, to yearn to impress one's personality upon
   one's fellow-men, is the essence of ambition. The ambitious person may
   think that he merely thirsts to "do something" or "be somebody" but
   really what he craves is to figure potently in the minds of others, to
   be greatly loved, admired, or feared. To reap a success which no one
   .................. does not satisfy the yearnings of the
   .................. individual.

26 Washington was a very silent man. Of no man in the world's history do
   we have so few sayings of a personal kind. As for talking about
   himself, that was something in which he almost never indulged. Yet it
   would be a great error to interpret his.................. as an
   indication that he was in any sense cold or unfeeling.

27 As a rule, it is more economical to remember things by associating them
   clearly and vigorously than by going through many repetitions of them.
   Thus, a clear understanding of the causes for the Democratic victory in
   the national election in 1916 will be.................. effective in
   remembering the fact than a dozen.................. of the statement
   "Woodrow Wilson was elected in 1916."

28 Fundamentally, education depends upon the capacity of a person to
   profit by past experiences. Past situations modify present and future
   adjustments. Education in its broadest sense means acquiring
   experiences that serve to.................. existing inherited or
   acquired tendencies of behavior.

29 "Naรฏve" and "unsophisticated" are frequently confused. The former
   suggests a type of behavior which is artless, spontaneous, and free
   from the restraints of custom. The latter implies fully as great lack
   of knowledge of social usage, and, in addition, conduct which is
   primitive and perchance inelegant. Thus, the.................. youth
   was the first to enter the car, and his.................. little
   sister warmly kissed him in the presence of the king. We may also say
   that a country boy is.................. with respect to city life and
   customs.
