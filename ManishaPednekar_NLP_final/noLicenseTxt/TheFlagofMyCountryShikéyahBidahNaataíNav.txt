NAVAJO NEW WORLD READERS


At this writing (1951) there are approximately 26,000 children of school
age on the Navajo reservation. About 40 percent of these are between the
ages of 12 and 18. The great majority have never been inside a school,
and do not speak English. Recently the government has provided space for
more than 4,000 of these non-English-speaking adolescents in ten of its
off-reservation boarding schools. A five-year intensive educational
program is provided designed to teach these children to speak, read,
write, and think in English; to do simple arithmetic, to know the facts
of American history, world geography, civics and health; and to provide
the basic skills which will enable them to obtain and hold a permanent
job away from the reservation. The reservation resources will support
only about half the present population.

We have learned how to teach these non-English-speaking Navajos to speak
and read English very rapidly. However, there isn't much material for
them to read. They are maturing adolescents with adolescent interests.
Primers and first readers prepared for use by six-year-old school
children don't have much interest for them. Because most non-Indians
learn to read when they are young, very few books are published in which
the ideas are mature, but the vocabularies simple enough for beginning
readers. The Bureau of Indian Affairs, therefore, has undertaken the
preparation and printing of booklets written by the leaders who are
working directly with these children. Because the children are entering
a new culture, and their success will depend upon the degree to which
they make the basic ideas of this culture their own, these new books
will rely on the material of this new culture for their content. They
will present to these young people a new and different world from that
through which they have grown during their early years on the
reservation.
