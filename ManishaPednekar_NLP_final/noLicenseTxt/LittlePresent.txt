THE OX.


An Ox has two horns, four legs, and four feet. The ox draws the plough
and the cart. He is large and strong, and he works hard for man. He eats
grass, and hay, and corn; and drinks water.

THE COW.


A Cow is not so large as an ox. She does not work, but she gives milk.
Butter and cheese are made of milk. A Calf is a young cow or ox.

helps to plough the field.

THE CAT.


A Cat is good to catch mice and rats. We call a cat, puss. Puss has
sharp claws, and sharp teeth. If you pull her hair or tail, she will
scratch or bite you. A cat and a dog can see in the dark. Puss hunts for
rats and mice in the night.

THE DOG.


The Dog keeps watch in the night, and barks at thieves. A good dog will
drive the hogs, and sheep, and geese out of the field, when they eat the
corn. If you are kind to him, he will not bite you.

THE SHEEP.

Sheep do not work, but they give us good wool to make our clothes. They
love grass, and hay, and corn. You may let them eat meal in your hand:
they will not bite you. A sheep has little lambs that skip and play.
