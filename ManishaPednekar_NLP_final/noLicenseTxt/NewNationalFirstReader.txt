[Illustration: PREFACE]

The authors of this book believe,--

1st.--_That the Word Method is the most natural and practicable,_
because words are representatives of objects, actions, etc., while
letters, or sounds, in the abstract, convey no meaning to the pupil, and
are devoid of interest.

2d.--_That words of ordinary length are as easily learned as short ones,
provided they are familiar to the pupil_. No teacher will doubt the
statement that a pupil will learn the word "mamma'" as easily as "says"
or "eyes."

3d.--_That frequent "Reviews" are essential to the rapid and thorough
advancement of pupils_. By this means the words imperfectly learned
are again brought to their attention and thoroughly memorized. That
these "Reviews" ought to take up the new words in a different order and
arrangement, in order to test the ability of the pupil to recognize them
in any situation. That as soon as the vocabulary is large enough they
should be written in the form of a new exercise, as on pp. 36, 44, 52,
60, and 68 of this book.  4th.--_That thorough and systematic drill in
Spelling is absolutely necessary_. That the "Reading Reviews" should
be so constructed as to contain all the new words used in the lessons
they were intended to review, and no others, so that they can be used
for "Written or Dictation Spelling." That the pronunciation of the words
in the "Spelling Reviews" should be indicated by the diacritical marks
of Webster, so that they can be used for either "Oral Spelling" or
"Phonic Drill."

5th.--_That the "Script" from which the pupil gets his first and most
lasting impressions should be of large size and accurate form_, and
not of the nondescript character usually found in books of this class.
That it should be free from superfluous line and flourish, and yet have
grace and beauty. That it should be adapted for both copying and
reading.

6th.--_That the lessons should be largely "conversational in style,"_
to cultivate flexibility of voice and to break up the dreary monotone so
frequently heard among children.

7th.--_That the lessons of a book of this grade should not average more
than seven "new words."_ That all such words should appear at the
commencement of lessons, and be familiar to the pupil. That this method
secures careful gradation, and is in marked contrast with the old custom
of having from fifteen to twenty-five.

8th.--_That "Outline Drawings" of the objects first presented to pupils
should be made in the presence of the class_, as it stimulates them to
draw, and thus makes easy and profitable the copying of the "Script
Exercises."

9th.--_That the schoolbook of to-day must be beautifully and copiously
illustrated_. That there must be variety as well as excellence, both in
drawing and engraving. That well-known and famous artists must be
secured, such as Harper, Fredericks, Church, Lippincott, Eytinge, White,
Beard, Weldon, Thulstrup, Cary, Moser, Weaver, and Share; and such
engravers as Karst, Wigand, French, Held, Davis, Hellawell, etc.

10th.--_That the exercises must be instructive as well as interesting,_
and that no artificial system of vowel classification ought to interfere
with the free and natural use of words.

11th.--_That a book of this kind should be suited to the wants of graded
and ungraded schools_, there evidently being nothing in the one not
readily adaptable to the other.

12th.--_That every book of this class should contain a collection of
brief extracts from standard literature_ to be committed to memory.

13th.--_That this book is constructed on the above principles_.

Now let us go and see the nest the hen made in the hay.

Well, come on. Mary will go too.

Here is the hen, Ned. Let us see if there are some little chicks under
her.

Ned, you hold the hen, and Mary will put her hand into the nest.

Is there a chick under her, Mary?

O yes! Take the hen off the nest.

Well! well! Do look at the dear little chicks. One, two, three, four,
five, six, of them.

Run, Ned, get some food, and we will feed them.

Will the hen take care of them?

Yes, she will hide them under her wings.

Mamma', did you see the kitty catch the little mousie in the barn?

Yes, kitty spied the mousie running to and fro.

I saw her pretty black eyes glow, and soon she caught the mousie in her
paws.

What a pretty kitty she is! Her fur is like silk.

But look, mamma'! There is the man coming with his bear. May I go out to
see him?

Yes, Fred, but Frank must go with you.

How well the bear stands up on his hind legs!

Yes, and see how he holds the stick in his paws.

O see him dance! What funny things he does!  Where did the man get him,
Frank? Did you ask him?

Yes, and he said that one time, a long while ago, he and his dogs were
out hunting, and saw the bear up in a tree.

The bear was small then, so he was not afraid of him.

He cut the tree down, and as soon as it fell, the dogs caught the bear.

Did they hurt him, Frank?

No, the man did not let them hurt him.

See, Frank, the man is coming here.

How do you do, boys?

We like to see your bear play. We think he likes you.

John and his cat Dick do not like rats. They catch all they can.  One
time, John set a trap to catch some, and then went away and hid with
Dick.

Pretty soon a big rat came out of its hole and went to the trap.

Dick saw the rat, and made a start to get away from John. But John said,
"Hold on, Dick, let us see if it will go into the trap."

But the rat did not go in, and as it was going to run away, John let
Dick go, and said, "Catch it, Dick. Run quick, quick!" and they ran very
fast to catch the rat.

But the rat was too quick for them. It went into its hole just as Dick
was very near it.

Not yet, but I think they soon will be. They let me set food near them
now.

When they are tame, you can let them out of the cage.

What a funny cap one of them has!

It looks like a cap, Mary, but it is not. It is a crest.

Many redbirds have no crest, and I am glad that one of your birds has
one.

Will these birds sing well?

They sing very little. Redbirds are pretty, but they do not sing so well

I went to dip a dish into the brook to get some water, and saw this

Then I said, "O Frank, look, look quick! See the little fish!"

Frank saw it, and ran to get his fish net. He put the net into the
water, and caught the fish, and I put it into this dish.

"Well, what will you do with it?

I will keep it, mamma'.

But, my boy, it will not live in that dish. Put it back into the brook.

I wish I could keep it. It is so pretty! May I put it into the pond?

No, John. You must put it into the brook. A trout will not live in warm

his dog Rover. The fox was afraid of Rover, and ran away.

When Rover saw the fox start, he ran after him. O how they did go! They
ran and ran, up hill, and down hill, but the fox ran faster than Rover,

One day Ann and Frank went to the lake with Rover.

Rover can swim well, so Frank made him go into the water after a stick.

"Jump, Rover! Jump in and get the stick," said Frank; and into the water
he went with a big splash.

[Illustration]

Pretty soon he came out with the stick in his mouth.

He did not like the fun so well as Frank, for the water was a little
cold.

They had a fine time for a while with Rover, and then set out for home,
as it was late in the day, and they could not stay long.

On the way home, Rover saw a rabbit, and away he went after it, as fast
as he could go.

Ann and Frank ran too, but could not keep up with Rover and the rabbit.

When they got home, Rover was there, and Frank said--

"Where is the rabbit, Rover?"

Rover gave Frank a funny look and went away.

"O I know!" said Frank, "the rabbit ran so fast you could not catch it."

Look, sister! See that eagle!

Yes, Frank, I see two eagles. What large wings they have!

Yes, they fly over the beach to find fish.

Do they eat fish, Frank?

Yes, they are very fond of fish. The eagle is a large and strong bird.
Mamma' saw one take up a rabbit and fly off with it.

I wish we could catch one, Frank. How funny it would look in a cage!

Yes, sister, but you would have to get a much larger cage than the one
your redbirds have.

O I am afraid it would hurt me. If it got out of the cage, it would fly
away with me.

No, it could not do that, but it could hurt you with its strong beak.

What is its beak, Frank?

The beak is its mouth. All birds have a beak, but not many have one so
strong as that of the eagle.

You are very kind, Mary, to have a nice fire for me. I am cold after my
long drive.

Yes, Fred, you look cold and tired, but you will soon get warm by this
fire. How far did you drive?

Seven miles, and the snow and ice made it a cold ride.

Can we skate on the lake now, Fred?

Yes, the ice is strong. We can have a good skate. Do you want to go and
try it?

O yes, Fred! I like to skate. Will you go with me?

Yes, as soon as I get warm. But John and Ann are coming over to see us.

Well, Fred, we will ask them to go with us. Ann likes to skate.

O yes! if they go, we shall have a merry time.

What fun it will be, Fred! I will run now and find my hat. We will go as
soon as they come.

Papa', I want to sail in the new boat. Will you take me out?

It is pretty cold, Frank. See how the wind blows, and how the waves roll
on the beach. I know it is cold, papa', but I have on a warm coat.

Well, come on. I will hold the boat while you get in.

So Frank and his papa' got into the boat and put up the sail.

The waves were very high, but Frank was not afraid. The boat was strong,
and his papa' could sail it well.

The waves dashed over the side of the boat, but the more they dashed,
the more fun it was for Frank.

When Frank got to be a man, he was so fond of the water that he went to
sea in a large ship.

He learned how to sail the ship, and after a while, he was made captain
of it.

He is an old man now, and likes to tell little boys and girls all he
learned and saw while he was captain of a ship.

One day, when Frank and John were going to school, they saw an old man
with a flute.

"Will you please play a tune for us, sir?" said Frank.

"Yes, boys, I will play for you. Are you fond of music?" "Yes, sir, we
like music. You used to play your flute when I went with mamma' to see
you."

"O you are the little boy who had your flute with you, are you?"

[Illustration]

"Yes, sir, and I have learned to play a little on it."

"Well, I am glad to see you again, my boy.

"I will play you a tune, and then you must play for me."

"But my flute is at home, sir."

"O well, you can use mine. It is a good one."

The old man played a tune for the boys, and then gave the flute to Frank
to play.

Frank played a tune, and did it very well.

"How well you play!" said the old man.

"You are very kind to say that, but I wish I could play as well as you
do," said Frank.

"O you will soon do that. All you will have to do is to try."

PEARLS IN VERSE.[A]

  Be the matter what it may,
    Always speak the truth.
  If at work, or if at play,
    Always speak the truth.

       *       *       *       *       *

  Do your best, your very best,
    And do it every day.
  Little boys and little girls,
    That is the wisest way.

       *       *       *       *       *

  Little children, love each other,
    Never give another pain,
  If your brother speak in anger,
    Answer not in wrath again.

       *       *       *       *       *

  Early to bed and early to rise,
  Make men healthy, wealthy, and wise.

[Footnote A: It is intended that these selections shall be memorized by
pupils, but as they do not form any part of the reading lessons, the
words not heretofore used are not regarded as "new words."]

  Suppose your task, my little man,
    Is very hard to get?
  Will it make it any easier
    For you to sit and fret?

  Then wouldn't it he wiser
    Than waiting like a dunce,
  To go to work in earnest,
    And learn the thing at once?

       *       *       *       *       *

  Speak the truth, and speak it ever,
    Cost it what it will;
  He who hides the wrong he did,
    Does the wrong thing still.

       *       *       *       *       *

  To do to others as I would
    That they should do to me,
  Will make me honest, kind, and good,
    As children ought to be.

       *       *       *       *       *

  When mother says, "Do this," or "that,"
    Don't say, "What for?" and "Why?"
  But let her hear your gentle voice
    Say, "Mother dear, I'll try."
