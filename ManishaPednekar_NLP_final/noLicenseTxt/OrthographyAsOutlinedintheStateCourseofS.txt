                               PREFACE.


This book is prepared for teachers and pupils who use the Illinois
State Course of Study. The outline in Orthography for the Seventh and
Eighth Years is the basis of all that is included herein. Three fifths
or more of this work is word analysis which, valuable as it is,
teachers as a rule are unable to teach without the aid of a text,
never having learned much of it themselves. What, for example, can the
average teacher unaided do toward writing a list of words to be
analyzed which contain the root _ann_, meaning year? He might turn in
the dictionary to _annual_, _anniversary_, and _annuity_, but he must
fall back on his acquired knowledge for such as, _biennial_,
_centennial_, _millennium_, _perennial_, and _superannuate_. And
having the list, very many teachers, as well as pupils, need help in
the analysis.

The aim of this book has been to set down in an orderly and convenient
form such facts as are needed by those who follow the State Course of
Study.

Emphasis has been placed upon word analysis. The author believes that
this has more value in education than is generally attributed to it.
When Mr. Kennedy named his work on word analysis “What Words Say”, he
gave it the best possible title. Composite words have a wealth of
meaning; each syllable is significant. And, as a rule, only to those
who can read this significance does the word yield its full meaning.
Accuracy is the mark of a scholar. Accuracy in speech and in the
understanding of speech cannot be attained by those whose knowledge of
words is vague and general. Pupils should early learn how to interpret
_what words say_, and to discriminate carefully in the use of words,
for these are the tools which they are to use in all the various
departments for acquiring knowledge.

                             INTRODUCTION

                        BY DR. EDWIN C. HEWETT.


I have long thought that the careful, discriminating study of words is
much neglected in our schools. And I am glad to approve, and help to
forward, anything that will promote such a study.

Not only will such a study improve a person's language greatly, but it
will, at the same time, do much to improve the clearness and precision
of his thinking; thought and language have a reciprocal effect.

If a child, while young, can be made to be interested in words
themselves,—their origin, their exact meaning, their relations to
each other and some of the changes in their meaning which result from
their use,—he will be likely to retain that interest through life; it
will be more likely to increase than to diminish.

It seems often to be assumed that a student can do nothing profitably
with the study of words made up from Greek and Latin roots till he has
acquired some mastery of those languages. But I know from experience
and much observation that this is not true. Why should it be? Must one
master Greek and Latin before he can understand that, in English
words, _graph_ means write; _ge_ means earth; _phone_ means sound;
_cur_ means run; _fin_ means limit; _port_ means carry, etc.?

And then having learned the meaning of the prefixes and suffixes, is
it preposterous to train him to know the etymological significance of
a few hundred words by showing him how they are built up?

Of course, we know that many words in common use have shades of
meaning quite different from, and in some cases almost opposite to,
their literal significance. But will not the student be better able to
understand these derived meanings by knowing their literal
significance than in any other way? At any rate, I am fully persuaded
that such a study of words as this book proposes can be made very
profitable to those pupils for whose use it is prepared.

The teacher will find, however, that the teaching of this subject will
require much careful labor on his part. The mere learning of the
meaning of prefixes and suffixes and of the roots themselves, with the
brief remarks on the meaning of some of the words, will need to be
supplemented by a careful mastery of it all on his part. And to this
must be added much thought of his own, together with careful research
in the great dictionaries. But to the earnest and intelligent teacher,
such thought and research will yield very rich fruit in his own
thinking, and in his use of English speech.

I cheerfully commend the book as a move in the right direction; and as
adapted, in my opinion, to do much to supply a serious lack in the
present work of the schools.

Normal, Ill., Aug. 18, 1904. E. C. H.




                       SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS.


1. From the lists given in this book omit such words as in your
opinion are beyond the vocabulary of your pupils.

2. All words given for the first month's work are either defined or
illustrated below the lists. This is done to help make clear the
method of showing their _literal_ significance. Further along in each
year's work only the most difficult words are explained. Insist that
pupils in every case where it is possible define or illustrate so as
to show the _literal_ meaning, else much of the value of the study is
lost.

And, moreover, the ordinary, or current meaning, _where it differs
from the literal_, should be given. Very many of the words have
various uses. Thorough work requires that these be illustrated. This
necessitates a free use of the dictionary.

It is strongly urged that the pupils (with the aid of the teacher when
necessary) try to find _an appropriate sentence to illustrate each
word_ and write the same in an orderly way in a note book for the
purpose.

In work of this kind a teacher should not underrate the value of
reviews. By this means fix facts on the minds of your pupils,
especially the meanings of roots and prefixes. Since these meanings
are given in a single word, reviews may proceed rapidly.

One convenient method of recitation in this subject is to send pupils
to the blackboard without their books, assign them by turns words to
be analyzed according to the examples given under “Directions to
Pupils”, and then let each pupil read to the class what he has written
on the board.




                         DIRECTIONS TO PUPILS.


Given in the seventh and eighth years' work of the State Course of
Study are 45 prefixes, 64 roots, and 33 suffixes,—in all 142 elements
or component parts of words. In this book a list of words is furnished
to illustrate each element, the average number of words in each list
being about eleven, and the total number of different words analyzed,
or partially analyzed, is over 1200.


                          TO ANALYZE A WORD.

1. Name its component parts—root, prefix, and suffix—and give the
literal meaning of each.

2. Combine these meanings in a definition, _supplying additional words
if necessary_, to make the sense complete. In exceptional cases,
however, the exact literal meanings of the parts cannot be put
together in a good definition. One or more of the parts must then be
omitted entirely, or represented by words which are not exactly
literal.

3. Give an illustration of the use of the word.

(Caution: Carefully distinguish verbs, adjectives and nouns. Do not
define adjectives as nouns or verbs, or vice versa. Do not, for
illustration, say _audible_ is _that which_ can be _heard_; but rather
say _audible_ means _capable of_ being _heard_.)


                               EXAMPLES.

avert: (1) _a_, away + _vert_, turn.
       (2) To _turn away_; to ward off.
       (3) The evils which exist are necessary to _avert_ greater evils.

deify: (1) _dei_, god + _fy_, to make.
       (2) To _make_ a _god_ of; to praise and revere as if a deity.
       (3) The people of India _deify_ the Ganges River.

hostile: (1)_host_, enemy + _ile_, belonging to.
         (2) _Belonging to_ or having the characteristics of an _enemy_.
         (3) Yon tower which rears its head so high invites the
             _hostile_ winds.

portable: (1) _port_, carry + _able_, capable of.
          (2) _capable of_ being _carried_ or moved from place to place;
              not stationary.
          (3) A _portable_ photograph gallery stopped for three
              days at the cross-roads near my home.

benefactor: (1) _bene_, good + _fact_, make, do + _or_, one who.
            (2) _One who does good_; especially one who makes a
                charitable donation.
            (3) “He is a true _benefactor_ and alone worthy of honor who
                brings comfort where before was wretchedness, who dries
                the tear of sorrow.”

A careful study of the five examples given above will reveal that to
analyze words a pupil must—

1. Learn some _facts_—meanings of the component parts of words.

2. Be careful in putting these facts together to make a sensible
definition.

3. Use the dictionary to find the ordinary, or current, use of a word.

4. Gather illustrations. This is not easy, but it should not be
neglected, for it is the most practical feature of word analysis.
Pupils should help each other, and the teacher may contribute when his
help is needed. One good illustration for a difficult word might
suffice the entire class.

                         TERMS TO BE DEFINED.

An ELEMENTARY SOUND is the simplest sound of spoken language.

There are forty-four elementary sounds in the English language. As
there are only twenty-six letters in the alphabet some letters
represent more than one sound. Certain marks or distinguishing
characters used with the letters to indicate the various sounds are
called DIACRITICAL MARKS.

PHONOTYPY is a method of representing each of the elementary sounds by
a distinct printed character or letter.

The VOCALS or TONICS are those elementary sounds made by an unmodified
or uninterrupted tone of the voice; as ā, ĕ.

The SUBVOCALS or SUBTONICS are those elementary sounds made by the
tone of the voice modified by the organs of speech, making an
undertone; as b, d, g, r.

The ASPIRATES or ATONICS are those elementary sounds made by merely
breathing modified by the organs of speech; sometimes called breath
sounds; as p, t, s.

                               LETTERS.

A LETTER is a mark or character used to represent a sound,—usually an
elementary sound.

An ALPHABET is an orderly arrangement of all the letters of a
language.

The NUMBER OF LETTERS in the different alphabets vary, as follows:
English 26, Arabic 28, French 25, German 26, Greek 24, Hebrew 22,
Italian 21, Russian 33, Spanish 27, Sanskrit 49. The Chinese have no
alphabet, but about 20,000 syllabic characters.

The POWER OF A LETTER is the elementary sound for which it stands.

LETTERS AS TO FORM are either script or print.

There are many different STYLES OF LETTERS; as, Roman, Italic, Old
English, and Script.

As to SIZE letters are both capital and lower case.


                           #[Third Month.]#

                                VOWELS.

A VOWEL sound is a free and uninterrupted sound of the voice. The
vowel sounds are formed by the voice modified, but not interrupted, by
the various positions of the tongue and lips.

A CONSONANT sound is an articulate sound made by the obstructed voice,
and which in utterance is usually combined with a vowel sound.

There is no absolute division between vowels and consonants. Certain
vowels are so open as to be only vowels, certain consonants are so
close as to be only consonants; but there are yet others which have
the value now of vowels and now of consonants; as, _i_, _u_, _w_, and
_y_.

“_Y_ as a vowel is a substitute for _i_, and _i_ is a consonant as a
substitute for _y_. _W_ and _y_ are vowels: (1) When they end words or
syllables, (2) when they are not followed by a vowel in the same
syllable, (3) when they are followed by a silent vowel in the same
syllable. _W_ and _y_ are consonants when they begin words or
syllables and are immediately followed by a vowel. _I_ is a consonant
when it represents the consonant _y_, as in _alien_. _U_ is a
consonant when it represents the consonant _w_, as in _quick_,
_language_.”—_Irish's Orthography._

A DIPHTHONG is produced by running together two vowel sounds in the
same syllable.

A diphthong is PROPER if both the vowels are sounded; as _o_ and _i_
in _boil_.

An IMPROPER DIPHTHONG or DIGRAPH is merely a collection of two vowels
in the same syllable, of which only one is sounded; as in _rain_,
_teach_.

The diphthongs in the following words are all that are in common use,
viz.: t_oi_l, t_oy_, s_ou_nd, c_ow_, p_ea_l, _oi_l, _au_dible,
_aw_ning, s_ay_, s_ei_ne, p_eo_ple, f_eu_d, ob_ey_, esch_ew_,
bel_ie_ve, l_oa_n, h_oe_, h_ue_, j_ui_ce. Of these _oi_, _oy_, _ou_,
and _ow_ are the only _proper_ diphthongs.

A TRIPHTHONG is produced by running together three vowel sounds in the
same syllable.

A triphthong is PROPER if all three of the vowels are sounded. (But
there are no proper triphthongs that I know of.)

A triphthong is IMPROPER or is called a TRIGRAPH if one or two of the
three vowels is silent; as in ad_ieu_, b_eau_ty.


                           #[Fourth Month.]#

                              CONSONANTS.

CONSONANTS are divided on three different bases; as follows:

I. MUTES and SEMIVOWELS.

The mutes represent an explosive sound, and are so called because the
mouth organs are closed just before the sound is uttered and the voice
is momentarily _mute_.

The four subvocals _b_, _d_, _j_, _g_, and their cognates, _p_, _t_,
_ch_, and _k_, are generally classed as mutes. Pronounce them and see
if they do not represent _explosive_ sounds.

All other consonants are _semivowels_, and are pronounced with a
_continuous_ sound. The sound may be continued so long as the breath
lasts; but in the case of mutes the sound must stop with the explosive
utterance.

II. The SUBVOCALS and ASPIRATES are shown in the vertical columns of
the table below. The subvocals are sometimes called _voice_ consonants
and the aspirates _breath_ consonants. These are fit terms, for they
indicate the basis of classification.

III. LABIALS, LINGUA-DENTALS, and PALATALS constitute a classification
of the consonants with respect to the place of formation. Bead the
table from left to right. The _lips_ have most to do with making the
labial sounds; the lingua-dentals are formed at the point of the
_tongue_ in contact with the _teeth_, the palatals between the tongue
and hard and soft _palate_.

                              SYLLABLES.

SYLLABLE literally means _taken together_.

A SPOKEN SYLLABLE is an elementary sound, or a combination of
elementary sounds, uttered _together_, or with a single impulse of the
voice. It constitutes a word or a part of a word.

A WRITTEN or printed syllable is a part of a word separated from the
rest, and capable of pronunciation by a single impulse of the voice.

As to where a word shall be divided in making it into syllables
depends upon the PURPOSE OF SYLLABICATION. When the purpose is to show
the derivation the division is made with reference to the component
parts (roots, prefixes, and suffixes); but if the purpose is to
indicate correct pronunciation, the result may be very different. For
illustration, the following words are divided, first, to show
derivation: abs-tract, bene-vol-ent, pre-de-cess-or, e-duc-ate,
phon-o-typ-y, pro-gress, e-lig-ible; and, second, to indicate correct
pronunciation: ab-stract, be-nev-o-lent, pred-e-ces-sor, ed-u-cate,
pho-not-y-py, prog-ress, el-i-gi-ble.

While in the illustrations here given the syllables formed for one
purpose are very different from those formed for the other, yet in the
majority of words the resulting syllables are the same whether divided
for one purpose or for the other.

In the United States the prevailing purpose of syllabication is to
indicate pronunciation.

The ULTIMATE syllable of a word is the last (_ultimus_ = last); the
PENULTIMATE is next to the last (_pen_ = almost); the ANTEPENULTIMATE
is the third from the last (literally, _before almost_ the _last_);
the PREANTEPENULTIMATE is the fourth from the last (literally,
_before_ the one that is _before_ the one _almost last_).

                                ACCENT.

ACCENT is stress of voice on a particular syllable in pronouncing a
word.

In long words two, and sometimes three, syllables are accented. But
one syllable is always accented more strongly than the others are. The
stronger accent is called the PRIMARY accent, the weaker is called the
SECONDARY. Thus, in _am´ mu ni´ tion_ the primary accent falls on the
third syllable and the secondary on the first.

The “PRINCIPLES” which govern the placing of accent are complicated.
The International Dictionary says there are no principles by which to
determine the accent in English. Another high authority says: “All
attempts to assign rules for the place of the accent in English only
serve to render the subject hopelessly intricate and confounded.”

There are, however, certain _tendencies_ which mature pupils might
profitably consider, but the limited scope of this book will not
permit me to attempt to set them forth.

In the words of the following list the accent changes with a change of
meaning. When nouns or adjectives these words are accented on the
first syllable; when verbs, on the second:

                                WORDS.

A WORD is a sign of an idea. It may be either spoken or written.

A PRIMITIVE, OR ROOT, word is one not derived from any other word of
the language; as, _fix_, _strike_, _man_.

A DERIVATIVE is a word formed from a primitive by changing it
internally, or by adding a prefix or suffix; as, _men_, _suffix_,
_strikers_.

A SIMPLE WORD is a single word. It may be either primitive or
derivative.

A COMPOUND WORD is a combination of two or more simple words; as,
buck-saw, well-behaved, school-room.

A word of one syllable is a _monosyllable_ (mono = one); of two
syllables, a _dissyllable_ (dis = two); of three syllables, a
_trisyllable_ (tri = three); of three or more syllables, a
_polysyllable_ (poly = many).

The ROOT of a word is its fundamental or elementary part which carries
the primitive notion or significance with it, without prefix or
suffix; as, _ge_ (earth), _graph_ (write), _vol_ (wish).

A PREFIX is a significant syllable joined to the beginning of a word;
as, _auto_graph, _circum_vent, _amphi_theater.

A SUFFIX is a significant syllable joined to the end of a word; as,
man _ly_, fert _ile_, ment _ion_.

AFFIX is a general term for prefixes and suffixes; it may be applied
to either or to both together.

                            SILENT LETTERS.

Silent letters have at least four uses:

1. To modify sounds of other letters in the same syllable.

Drop final silent _e_ from such words as the following and note the
effect on the sound of the other vowel in the same syllable: _bare_,
_pure_, _ripe_, _lame_.

2. To indicate pronunciation.

In the four words last given, for illustration, the pronunciation
changes when the final silent _e_ is dropped.

Another class of words ending in _ce_ and _ge_ retain the final silent
_e_ on adding a suffix beginning with _a_ or _o_ to preserve the soft
sound of _c_ and _g_, and with it the correct pronunciation of the
word; as, _serviceable_, _noticeable_, _changeable_, _courageous_.

3. To show the meaning of words.

Illustrations: _clime_, _climb_, _plumb_, _belle_, _butt_, _dyeing_,
_singeing_, _guilt_, _damn_.

4. To show the derivation of words.

Numerous illustrations are found in words derived from the Greek. In
_chronic_, and _chronology_, the _h_ is silent, but serves to indicate
that the root of those words is identical with the Greek root _chron_,
which means _time_. Similarly the _g_ in _gnostic_, the _e_ in
_eulogy_, _p_ in _pneumonia_, the _h_ in _chromatic_.

In _honour_ and _favour_ _u_ is silent, and therefore a useless
letter, so far as sound is concerned. The _u_ signifies that the word
came to us through the French, instead of directly from the Latin. The
question is, whether we shall go to the trouble of writing the extra
letter in a large class of such words for the sake of the historical
association. Perhaps one in a thousand would choose to do so, but
others of us are more intent on saving time and ink. When the spelling
reform idea becomes operative with English speaking people, a great
many silent letters will go the way of the _u_ in _labour_, _favour_,
and the like.

The following are some of the numerous classes of silent letters
together with the principle found to be operative through them.

                          RULES OF SPELLING.

Many people think that rules of spelling are of no value, because they
are hard to remember and because of numerous exceptions. This is
certainly true of a great many such rules (and there are a great
many); but three or four of these rules apply to so many words
difficult to spell, and they have such a small number of exceptions
that they are well worth while. Several hundred words are spelled
according to the first rule given below. The rule itself is short, and
all of the exceptions could be learned “for keeps” by a pupil in an
hour. But _pupils must have drill in applying the rules_ or they may
be able to repeat the rules perfectly and glibly and not be able to
spell the words coming under them.

Since the rule given for the work of the first month, seventh year,
and that given for the second month, are counterparts, each of the
other, I prefer to take them together. Knowing that “_silent final e
is dropped when a suffix beginning with a vowel is added_”, we
naturally infer its counterpart, viz.: “_Silent final e is retained
when a suffix beginning with a consonant is added._”

To bring about the necessary drill and insure attention to the
application of the rule, I suggest that a class of pupils, reciting by
turns, spell at least twenty-five words according to the following
model. [The words are on the board in this form: love + able, care +
less.]

“The suffix _able_ begins with the vowel _a_; therefore when it is
added to the word _love_ the final silent _e_ is dropped, and the word
is spelled _lovable_.” Or,

“The suffix _less_ begins with the consonant _l_; therefore, when it
is added to the word _care_ the final silent _e_ is not dropped, and
the word is spelled _careless_.”

Words to be spelled according to this model should be mixed,—those in
which the suffix to be added begins with a vowel mixed with those in
which the suffix begins with a consonant. Exceptions ought to be
thrown into the mixture, and when a pupil comes to an exception, he
can proceed according to the model, concluding with, “but this word is
an exception to the rule”.

Fifty words are here given to illustrate this rule, but pupils who
want to do thorough work should spell several such fifties.

Five other exceptions, to be remembered together: argument, judgment,
lodgment, abridgment, acknowledgment.

The exceptions here given, which are practically all of the exceptions
to this rule, should be reviewed until they cannot be forgotten. The
value of the rule depends much on a thorough committal of the
exceptions.

Rule II: “When a suffix is added to a word ending in _y_, preceded by

“The _y_ in _supply_ is preceded by a consonant, therefore, when the
suffix _ed_ is added the _y_ is changed to _i_ and the word is
spelled, _supplied_.” Or,

“The _y_ in display is preceded by a vowel, therefore when the suffix
_ed_ is added the _y_ is not changed, and the word is spelled,
_displayed_.”

final consonant on receiving a suffix beginning with a vowel.” This
rule carries with it the inference that the final consonant is not
doubled unless these conditions are all complied with.

Model for drill on this rule:

“_Refer_ is not a monosyllable, but it is accented on the last
syllable; it ends in a single consonant _r_, preceded by a single
vowel _e_; therefore, on adding the suffix _ed_, beginning with the
vowel _e_, the final consonant _r_ is doubled, and the word is
spelled, _referred_.”

* After _q_, _u_ is a consonant.


                              EXCEPTIONS.

The final consonant is not doubled when, in the derivative, the accent
is thrown from the last syllable of the primitive; as, _re fer´_,
_ref´er ence_.

ref´er ence    def´er ence    ref er ee´
pref er ence   in fer ence    ref´er a ble _or_
con fer ence   pref er a ble   re fer´ri ble


                           OTHER EXCEPTIONS.

gas es         (but gassy)     tranquillity
gas eous       humbug ging     trans fer able
crystallize    humbug ged      ex cellence

NOTE.—There is a large class of words ending in _l_, and accented on
some other syllable than the last, in whose derivatives the _l_ is
doubled by many writers; but it accords more with the analogy of the
language not to double the _l_. Such words are the following: apparel,
cancel, channel, cudgel, dishevel, drivel, duel, enamel, equal,
gambol, grovel, jewel, libel, marshal, marvel, metal, model, panel,
peril, quarrel.
