[Transcriber's Notes:

Welcome to the schoolroom of 1900. The moral tone is plain. "She is kind
to the old blind man."

The exercises are still suitable, and perhaps more helpful than some
contemporary alternatives. Much is left to the teacher. Explanations given
in the text are enough to get started teaching a child to read and write.
Counting in Roman numerals is included as a bonus in the form of lesson
numbers.

Each lesson begins with vocabulary words, followed by the description of a
picture (if any) related to the lesson's reading exercise. The lesson then
consists of printed text for reading and sometimes script (handwriting)
for reading or copying.

SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS.

This First Reader may be used in teaching reading by any of the methods in
common use; but it is especially adapted to the Phonic Method, the Word
Method, or a combination of the two.

I. Phonic Method.--First teach the elementary sounds and their
representative, the letters marked with diacriticals, as they occur in the
lessons; then, the formation of words by the combination of these sounds.
For instance, teach the pupil to identify the characters a, o, n, d, g, r,
and th, in Lesson I, as the representatives of certain elementary sounds;
then teach him to form the words at the head of the lesson, then other
words, as nag, on, and, etc. Pursue a similar course in teaching the
succeeding lessons. Having read a few lessons in this manner, begin to
teach the names of the letters and the spelling of words, and require the
groups, "a man," "the man," "a pen," to be read as a good reader would
pronounce single words.

II.  When one of the letters in the combinations ou or ow, is marked in
the words at the head of the reading exercises, the other is silent. If
neither is marked, the two letters represent a diphthong. All other
unmarked vowels in the vocabularies, when in combination, are silent
letters. In slate or blackboard work, the silent letters may be canceled.

III. Word Method.--Teach the pupil to identify at sight the words placed
at the head of the reading exercises, and to read these exercises without
hesitation. Having read a few lessons, begin to teach the names of the
letters and the spelling of words.

IV. Word Method and Phonic Method Combined.--Teach the pupil to identify
words and read sentences, as above. Having read a few lessons in this
manner, begin to use the Phonic Method, combining it with the Word Method,
by first teaching the words in each lesson as words; then the elementary
sounds, the names of the letters, and spelling.

V. Teach the pupil to use script letters in writing, when teaching the
names of the letters and the spelling of words.

Preface

In presenting McGuffeys Revised First Reader to the public, attention is
invited to the following features:

1. Words of only two or three letters are used in the first lessons.
Longer and more difficult ones are gradually introduced as the pupil gains
aptness in the mastery of words.

2. A proper gradation has been carefully preserved. All new words are
placed at the head of each lesson, to be learned before the lesson is
read. Their number in the early lessons is very small, thus making the
first steps easy. All words in these vocabularies are used in the text
immediately following.

3. Carefully engraved script exercises are introduced for a double
purpose. These should be used to teach the reading of script; and may also
serve as copies in slate work.

4. The illustrations have been designed and engraved specially for the
lessons in which they occur. Many of the engravings will serve admirably
as the basis for oral lessons in language.

5. The type is large, strong, and distinct.

The credit for this revision is almost wholly due to the  friends of
McGuffeys Readers,--eminent teachers and scholars, who have contributed
suggestions and criticisms gained from their daily work in the schoolroom.

Prince, and go to the big woods?"

"We can put the tent in the cart, and go to some nice spot where the grass
is soft and sweet."

"That will be fine," said Fanny. "I will get my doll, and give her a ride
with us."

"Yes," said John, "and we will get mamma to go, too. She will hang up a
swing for us in the shade."

and drag it to the pond. This will float with the dolls in it, and we can
get a pole to push it from the shore."

"What a funny boat, Kate! A tub for a boat, and a pole for an oar! Won't
it upset?"

"We can try it, Nell, and see."

"Well you get the tub, and I will get a pole and a rope. We will put both
dolls in the tub, and give them a ride."

James and Robert have gone into the shade of a high wall to play ball.

Mary and Lucy have come up from the pond near by, with brave old Ponto, to
see them play.

When they toss the ball up in the air, and try to catch it, Ponto runs to
get it in his mouth.

Now the ball is lost. They all look for it under the trees and in the
grass; but they can not see it. Where can it be?

See! Ponto has found it. Here he comes with it. He will lay it at little
Lucy's feet, or put it in her hand.

"Hoist it on our tent, papa. We are playing Fourth of July."

"Is that what all this noise is about? Why not hoist your own flags?"

"Oh! they are too little."

"You might spoil my flag."

"Then we will all join to pay for it. But we will not spoil it, papa."

"I will give it to you when it is finished," said John, kindly. "Would you

"Yes, very much, thank you, John. Has grandma seen it?"

See my dear, old grandma in her easy-chair! How gray her hair is! She
wears glasses when she reads.

She is always kind, and takes such good care of me that I like to do what
she tells me.

When she says, "Robert, will you get me a drink?"  I run as fast as I can

Then the flower shut it in.

"The bee likes honey as well as we do, but it does not like to be shut up

Frank is riding a horse, and James is driving one hitched to a cart. They
are out very early in the day. How happy they are!

See how well Frank rides, and how tight James holds the lines!

The boys should be kind to their horses. It is not best to whip them.

When they have done riding, they will give the horses some hay or corn.

[Illustration: Girl picking flowers.]


A little girl went in search of flowers for her mother. It was early in
the day, and the grass was wet. Sweet little birds were singing all around
her.

And what do you think she found besides flowers? A nest with young birds
in it.

While she was looking at them, she heard the mother bird chirp, as if she
said, "Do not touch my children, little girl, for I love them dearly."

The little girl now thought how dearly her own mother loved her.

So she left the birds. Then picking some flowers, she went home, and told
her mother what she had seen and heard.

It is noon, and the school is out. Do you see the children at play? Some
run and jump, some play ball, and three little girls play school under a
tree.

What a big room for such a small school!

Mary is the teacher. They all have books in their hands, and Fanny is
reading.

They are all good girls, and would not be rude even in playing school.

Kate and Mary listen to Fanny as she reads from her book.

What do you think she is reading about? I will tell you. It is about a
poor little boy who was lost in the woods.

When Fanny has finished, the three girls will go home.

In a little while, too, the boys will give up their playing.

Lucy has a new pet. Do you know what kind of bird it is? Lucy calls her
Polly.

Polly can say, "Poor Poll! Poor Poll! Polly wants a cracker;" and she can
mew like a cat.

But Polly and the cat are not good friends. One day Polly flew down, and
lit upon the cat's back when she was asleep.

I think she knew the cat would not like that, and she did it to tease her.

When Lucy pets the cat, Polly flies up into the old apple tree, and will
not come when she calls her. Then Lucy says, "What a silly bird!"



LESSON XLVI. REVIEW.


"Well, children, did you have a nice time in the woods?"

"Oh yes, mother, such a good time! See what sweet flowers we found, and
what soft moss. The best flowers are for grandma. Won't they please her?"

"Yes; and it will please grandma to know that you thought of her."

"When we came back, they were all safe. No one could get them while Rab
was there. We gave him some of the crackers from the basket.

"O mother, how the birds did sing in the woods!

"Fanny said she would like to be a bird, and have a nest in a tree. But I

These boys and girls live near the sea. They have been to the beach. It is

John, who sits on the front seat, found some pretty shells. They are in
the basket by his side.

Ben White is driving. He holds the lines in one hand, and his whip in the
other.

Robert has his hat in his hand, and is looking at the horses. He thinks
they are very lazy; they do not trot fast.

The children are not far from home. In a little while the sun will set,
and it will be bedtime.

Have you ever been at the seaside? Is it not good sport to watch the big
waves, and to play on the wet sand?

"Yes; may I go? and with you, father?"

"Yes, Frank, with me."

"Oh, how glad I am!"

Here they are, on the bank of a river. Frank has just pulled a fine fish
out of the water. How proud he feels!

See what a nice, quiet spot they have found. Frank has the stump of a big
tree for his seat, and his father sits on a log near by. They like the
sport.

snowballs, and to skate on the ice!

See the boys and girls! How merry they are! Henry has his sled, and draws
his little sister. There they go!

I think Henry is kind, for his sister is too small to skate.

Look! Did you see that boy fall down? But I see he is not hurt, for he is
laughing.

Some other boys have just come to join in the sport. See them put on their
skates.

"No, that was not the way. Puss was hid on a big box. The rat stole out,
and she jumped at it and caught it."

"Poor rat! It must have been very hungry; it came out to get something to

Mary and Lucy have come down to the beach with their grandpa. They live in
a town near the sea.

Their grandpa likes to sit on the large rock, and watch the big ships as
they sail far away on the blue sea. Sometimes he sits there all day long.

The little girls like to dig in the sand, and pick up pretty shells. They
watch the waves as they roll up on the beach, and break into white foam.

They sometimes make little houses of sand, and build walls around them;
and they dig wells with their small wooden spades.

They have been picking up shells for their little sister. She is too young
to come to the beach.

I think all children like to play by the seaside when the sun is bright,
and the wind does not blow too hard.

Every day, Mary's mother filled Frank's basket with bread and meat, and a
little tea for his grandma.

"How do you do, Frank?" said Mary. "Don't make a noise; my doll is going
to sleep. It is just a little sick to-day."

it whistle," said she, almost ready to cry.

"Sometimes they will whistle, and sometimes they won't," said Frank. "Try
again, Mary."

She tried once more, and the whistle made a low, sweet sound. "It
whistles!" she cried.

In her joy, she had turned the doll's face down, and its eyes shut tight,
as if it had gone to sleep.

"There!" cried Frank, "I told you the way to put a doll to sleep, is to
whistle to it."

"So it is," said Mary. "Dear, little thing; it must be put in its bed
now."

So they went into the house. Frank's basket was soon filled, and he went

There was once a big, white hen that had twelve little chickens. They were
very small, and the old hen took good care of them. She found food for
them in the daytime, and at night kept them under her wings.

One day, this old hen took her chickens down to a small brook. She thought
the air from the water would do them good.

When they got to the brook, they walked on the bank a little while. It was
very pretty on the other side of the brook, and the old hen thought she
would take her children over there.

There was a large stone in the brook: she thought it would be easy for
them to jump to that stone, and from it to the other side.

So she jumped to the stone, and told the children to come after her. For
the first time, she found that they would not obey her.

She flapped her wings, and cried, "Come here, all of you! Jump upon this
stone, as I did. We can then jump to the other side. Come now!"

"O mother! we can't, we can't, we can't!" said all the little chickens.

"Yes you can, if you try," said the old hen. "Just flap your wings, as I
did, and you can jump over."

"I am flapping my wings," said Chippy, who stood by himself; "but I can't
jump any better than I could before."

"I never saw such children," said the old hen. "You don't try at all."

"We can't jump so far, mother. Indeed we can't, we can't!" chirped the
little chickens.

"Well," said the old hen, "I must give it up." So she jumped back to the
bank, and walked slowly home with her brood.

"I think mother asked too much of us," said one little chicken to the
others.

"Well, I tried," said Chippy.

"We didn't," said the others; "it was of no use to try."

When they got home, the old hen began to look about for something to eat.
She soon found, near the back door, a piece of bread.

So she called the chickens, and they all ran up to her, each one trying to
get a bite at the piece of bread.

"No, no!" said the old hen. "This bread is for Chippy. He is the only one
of my children that really tried to jump to the stone."
