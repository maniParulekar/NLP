CHILDREN'S CLASSICS IN DRAMATIC FORM

BOOK TWO

BY AUGUSTA STEVENSON

Formerly a Teacher in the Indianapolis Public Schools

1908

FOREWORD


This series of books aims to serve three distinct purposes: first, to
arouse a greater interest in oral reading; second, to develop an
expressive voice--sadly lacking in the case of most Americans; and
third, to give freedom and grace in the bodily attitudes and movements
which are involved in reading and speaking. The stories given are for
the most part adaptations of favorite tales from folklore,--Andersen,
Grimm, Æsop, and the Arabian Nights having been freely drawn upon.

Children are dramatic by nature. They _are_ for the time the kings, the
fairies, and the heroes that they picture in their imaginations. They
_are_ these characters with such abandon and with such intense pleasure
that the on-looker must believe that nature intended that they should
give play to this dramatic instinct, not so much formally, with all the
trappings of the man-made stage, but spontaneously and naturally, as
they talk and read. If this expressive instinct can be utilized in the
teaching of reading, we shall be able both to add greatly to the child's
enjoyment and to improve the quality of his oral reading. In these days
when so many books are hastily read in school, there is a tendency to
sacrifice expression to the mechanics and interpretation of reading.
Those acquainted with school work know too well the resulting
monotonous, indistinct speech and the self-conscious, listless attitude
which characterize so much of the reading of pupils in grades above the
third. It is believed that these readers will aid in overcoming these
serious faults in reading, which all teachers and parents deplore. The
dramatic appeal of the stories will cause the child to lose himself in
the character he is impersonating and read with a naturalness and
expressiveness unknown to him before, and this improvement will be
evident in all his oral reading, and even in his speech.

The use of the books permits the whole range of expression, from merely
reading the stories effectively, to "acting them out" with as little, or
as much, stage-setting or costuming as a parent or teacher may desire.
The stories are especially designed to be read as a part of the regular
reading work. Many different plans for using the books will suggest
themselves to the teacher. After a preliminary reading of a story during
the study period, the teacher may assign different parts to various
children, she herself reading the stage directions and the other brief
descriptions unclosed in brackets. The italicized explanations in
parentheses are not intended to be read aloud; they will aid in giving
the child the cue as to the way the part should be rendered. After the
story has been read in this way, if thought advisable it can be played
informally and simply, with no attempt at costuming or theatric effects.
It will often add to the interest of the play to have some of the
children represent certain of the inanimate objects of the scene, as the
forest, the town gate, a door, etc. Occasionally, for the "open day," or
as a special exercise, a favorite play may be given by the children with
the simplest kind of costuming and stage-setting. These can well be made
in the school as a part of the manual training and sewing work. In
giving the play, it will generally be better not to have pupils memorize
the exact words of the book, but to depend upon the impromptu rendering
of their parts. This method will contribute more largely to the training
in English.

The best results will usually be obtained by using this book in the
third grade. In some schools, however, it may profitably be used in the
second grade.

WOLF. The water is muddled where I stand, miss.

LAMB. How can that be, sir?

WOLF. I say the water here is muddled.

LAMB. But, sir, the water runs from you to me.

WOLF. Oh, well, we will say no more about the water. Now just one year
ago you called me names.

[Illustration]

LAMB. How could that be, sir?

WOLF. I say you called me names, miss.

WOMAN. This cake is too large to give away. I will give you a slice of
bread.

[_She cuts a slice from a loaf of bread._]

BEGGAR. I thank you--

WOMAN. A slice is too much to give away. Here is a crust for you.

cake.

SECOND BLIND MAN (_feeling the tusk_). He is not like a wall! He is
round and smooth and sharp. He is like a spear.

THIRD BLIND MAN (_feeling the trunk_). Both of you are wrong. He is like
a snake.

FOURTH BLIND MAN (_feeling a leg_). Oh, how blind you are! He is round
and tall like a tree!

FIFTH BLIND MAN (_feeling an ear_). Why, he is exactly like a great fan!

SIXTH BLIND MAN (_feeling the tail_). This elephant is not like a wall,

FIRST BLIND MAN. Ha, ha, ha! Hear how he laughs at you!

hungry just to see them! Now if I could only swim! Or if I could walk on
water! Or if I had a little canoe!

[_Enter the_ CAMEL. _The Jackal whispers to himself._]

Aha! Now I know the way to get across.

(_To the Camel._)

Such news as I have for you, dear friend!

CAMEL. Must I guess?

JACKAL. No, I'll tell you this time. Listen: I know a spot where the
sugar-cane grows thick.

CAMEL. Tell me! I cannot wait! Tell me!

JACKAL. I cannot. I'll have to show you. It is on the other side of the
river.

CAMEL. Why, then, I'll swim across and take you on my back.

JACKAL. I cannot eat another one! Are you not ready to go?

CAMEL. Ready! Why, I have just begun.

JACKAL. I'll wait for you outside the field, then.

[_The Camel nods and disappears among the cane._]

Now I do not wish to wait for him. I am in a hurry to get home, I am. So
I'll sing a little song I know. The farmer then will come and drive the
camel out.

[_He goes. Soon he is heard singing in the distance. Enter the_ FARMER

CAMEL. Why did you sing so strangely?

[Illustration]

JACKAL. Oh, I don't know why! I always sing after dinner.

CAMEL. Ah! Well, let us go.

[_He kneels. The Jackal gets on his back. The Camel rises and enters the
river. He swims to the middle of the river and stops._]

JACKAL. Why do you stop?

CAMEL. I have such a strange, strange feeling.

JACKAL. Well, swim on. You need not stop!

CAMEL. I feel as if I must roll over.

JACKAL. Roll over! If you do, I shall be drowned!

CAMEL. Exactly. But still I have that feeling.

JACKAL. Now that is nonsense! Why should you roll over?

CAMEL. Oh, I don't know why! I always roll over after dinner.

Go on, I say!

STORY-TELLER. That is all, your Majesty.

KING. All!

STORY-TELLER. The prince married the princess. There is nothing more to
tell.

KING. I cannot bear so short a story!

PRINCESS. Why, father; for three months we have listened to it!

KING. 'Tis short, I say! I bid you make it longer, sir!

me.

SECOND STORY-TELLER. I hear, O King!

KING. If you fail, you shall lose your head. Begin! And remember, the
story must go on forever. Now again I say, begin!

SECOND STORY-TELLER. "Once upon a time a certain king seized upon all
the corn in his country. He had it stored in a strong granary. Then came
a swarm of locusts over the land. Soon they found a crack in the south
side of the granary. Now the crack was just large enough for one locust
to pass through at a time. So one locust went in and carried away a
grain of corn. Then another locust went in and carried away a grain of
corn. Then another locust went in and carried away a grain of corn.
Then--"

KING (_interrupting)._ Yes, yes! Now go on with the story.

SECOND STORY-TELLER. The story shall go on, O King! "Then another locust
went in and carried away another grain of corn. Then another locust--"

KING (_interrupting). I_ tell you to go on with the story!

SECOND STORY-TELLER. I obey, great King. "Then another locust went in
and carried away another grain of corn. Then another--"

KING. The story! The story, I tell you!

SECOND STORY-TELLER. This is the story, O King! "Then another locust
went in and carried away another grain of corn. Then--"

KING. I cannot stand it! How long will it take the locusts to carry away
all the grain?

SECOND STORY-TELLER. One thousand years, O King! "Then another locust
went in and--"

KING. Stop! Stop! Take my daughter! Be king after me! Be king now!
Anything to stop the locusts!

JACOB. Nor I!

FRIEDA. Nor I! It is too cold.

[_They go. Peter runs to the dike and looks at it carefully._]

PETER. Ah, I thought so! Here is a little hole! The water comes through
it from the sea. Soon the hole will be larger. I must find stones and
fill it.

(_He looks about for stones._)

Dear me! Dear me! I cannot find a single stone! What shall I do? The
hole will grow larger and larger. The sea will come in and cover all the
land. What shall I do? I cannot go and tell the people. That would take
too long. What shall I do? What shall I do?

       *       *       *       *       *

[_The_ THREE SONS _dig lazily among the vines._]

FIRST SON. Oh, I am tired of digging! Come, brothers, let us sit and
talk!

[_He throws down his spade and sits._]

[Illustration]

SECOND SON. Father said we should dig at every vine. But I must say I am
tired of it.

[_He throws down his spade and sits._]

THIRD SON. I was tired when we began.

[_He throws down his spade and sits. The_ FARMER _enters. His sons do
not see him._]

FIRST SON. Now I should like to go to war and ride a great white horse.

SECOND SON. I should like to be a prince. I would do nothing all day
long but wear my golden crown.

THIRD SON. I want to find a purse of gold. I would never work again, I
tell you!

[_The farmer shakes his head sadly._]

FARMER. My sons, these vines have not been dug about. Come, do this work
as I have told you.

(_The sons take up their spades, but unwillingly._)

Now listen: a pot of gold is hidden in this vineyard. It is buried deep
beneath these vines.

SONS. A pot of gold!

FARMER. It is all I have to leave you. I think it best to-tell you now,
for I cannot live much longer.

FIRST SON. Why do you hide the gold, my father?

FARMER. That you may dig for it.

SECOND SON. Why do you hide it in the ground?

FARMER. That you may dig for it.

THIRD SON. Why don't you tell us where it is?

FARMER. That you may dig for it.

[_He goes._]

SONS. A pot of gold!

FIRST SON. Now I shall go to war and ride a great white horse!

SECOND SON. Now I shall marry a princess and wear her golden crown!

THIRD SON. Now I shall find my purse of gold, and never work again!

[_The ground is completely dug up. The_ FIRST SON _is seen digging. He
throws down his spade showing disappointment._]

FIRST SON. I cannot find it!

(_Enter_ SECOND SON _with his spade._)

Did you find it?

SECOND SON. No, and I have dug up every inch of our western vineyard.

[_Enter_ THIRD SON _with his spade._]

FIRST AND SECOND SONS. Did you find it?

THIRD SON. No, and I have dug up every inch of the eastern vineyard.

FIRST SON. Well, you see what I have done here.

SECOND SON. Not a vine that has not been dug about!

THIRD SON. I cannot understand it!

FIRST SON. The day our father died he spoke again of the pot of gold.

SECOND SON. And told us again to dig for it.

THIRD SON. I cannot understand it.

MERCHANT. You say your grapes are ripe?

FIRST SON. They are ripe and ready to sell, sir.

SECOND SON. Come, now, and look at them.

[_They cross to the vines._]

MERCHANT. Why, I have never seen such grapes as these!

THIRD SON. We have never had such grapes before, sir.

MERCHANT. How fine and large they are!

FIRST SON. And sweet, too! Just taste one, sir!

MERCHANT (_eating a grape_). Are they all like these?

SECOND SON. Every vine bears just such grapes.

MERCHANT. I must have your grapes. I will give a pot of gold for them.

SONS. A pot of gold!

MERCHANT. Come, will you sell?

SONS. Aye, sir!

MERCHANT. Then to-morrow I will bring the pot of gold and take away the
grapes.

[_He goes._]

SONS. A pot of gold!

FIRST SON. I wonder if that was father's pot of gold.

SECOND SON. I almost think it was.

THIRD SON. I wonder now, I wonder--

FIRST SON. No war horse for me! I will stay and dig again for gold!

SECOND SON. No prince's crown for me! I will stay and dig here too!

THIRD SON. I have found my purse of gold! I will stay and find another!

[_The_ HEDGEHOG _and his_ WIFE _are walking in the field._]

HEDGEHOG. These cabbages are growing well.

WIFE. They are very fine indeed.

HEDGEHOG. We can feed on them all summer.

WIFE. Yes, if the hares will let us.

HEDGEHOG. Oh, there is enough for all of us, hares, hedgehogs, and
farmer.

WIFE. Yes, if the hares will think that, too.

HEDGEHOG. Well, we will let them alone as we have always done.

WIFE. But they will not let us alone. Yesterday they called at me while
I was eating here.

HEDGEHOG. What did they say to you?

WIFE. Oh, such things as "Short-legs," and "Duck-legs."

HEDGEHOG. Here comes one of them now!

WIFE. He is one who called at me. I'll hide till he goes by.

[_She hides among the cabbages. The_ HARE _enters._]

HEDGEHOG. Good-morning, sir.

HARE. Why do you speak to me?

HEDGEHOG. I always speak to neighbors, sir.

HARE. Speak to your own kind, then. I think myself too good for
hedgehogs.

HEDGEHOG. Now that is strange.

HARE. There is nothing strange about it. Look at your silly little legs!

HEDGEHOG. They are quite as good as yours, sir.

HARE. As good as mine! Hear him! You can only walk with those legs, sir.

HEDGEHOG. I'll run a race with you this day.

HARE. Hear him! Hear him! Ha, ha!

HEDGEHOG. You may run in that furrow. I will run in this. We will see
who gets to the field fence first.

HARE. Are you crazy?

HEDGEHOG. Come, come, let's begin the race!

HARE. Ha, ha! Well, I'll run with you. You ought to know just how silly
your little duck-legs are.

HEDGEHOG. Let us go to this end of the furrow to begin.

HAKE. I will run to the brook and back while you are getting there.

HEDGEHOG. As you please.

(_The Hare runs off._)

Wife, wife, did you hear?

WIFE. I heard. Are you crazy?

HEDGEHOG. Go to the other end of this furrow, wife.

WIFE. And why should I do that?

HEDGEHOG. The hare will run in the other furrow. When he comes to your
end, put up your head and say, "I am already here."

WIFE. Ha, ha! He will think that I am you.

HEDGEHOG. Exactly.

WIFE. Ha, ha, ha! I go, Mr. Hedgehog! I go! You may be short on legs, my
dear, but you are long on brains.

[_She runs to other end of furrow. Mr. Hedgehog goes to his end._]

[_The_ HARE _enters._]

HARE. Well, are you ready?

HEDGEHOG. I am ready.

HARE. One, two, three, go!

[_The Hare runs swiftly. The Hedgehog sits. The Hare reaches the other
end of his furrow. The Wife puts up her head._]

[Illustration]

WIFE. I am already here.

HARE. What is this?

WIFE. I am already here.

HARE. We will try again! Are you ready?

WIFE. I am ready.

HARE. One, two, three, go!

[_The Hare runs swiftly. The Wife sits. The Hare reaches the other end
of his furrow. Mr. Hedgehog puts up his head._]

HEDGEHOG. I am already here.

HARE. I cannot understand this.

HEDGEHOG. I am already here.

HARE. We will try again! Are you ready?

HEDGEHOG. I am ready.

HARE. One, two, three, go!

[_The Hare runs swiftly. Mr. Hedgehog sits. The Hare reaches the other
end of his furrow. Mrs. Hedgehog puts up her head._]

WIFE. I am already here.

HARE. I cannot believe it!

WIFE. I am already here.

HARE. We will try again! Do you hear? We will try again.

WIFE. I am ready.

HARE. One, two, three, go!

[_The Hare runs swiftly. The Wife sits. The Hare reaches the other end
of his furrow. Mr. Hedgehog puts up his head._]

HEDGEHOG. I am already here.

HARE. This is very, very strange!

HEDGEHOG. Shall we run again?

HARE. No, no! The race is yours, Neighbor Hedgehog. And will you please
to call some day? I should be glad to see you.

HEDGEHOG. I shall be glad to come.

[_The Hare goes off wondering._]

WIFE (_running to meet Mr. Hedgehog_). You may be short on legs, my
dear, but you are very, very long on brains.

[FARMER NIX, FARMER KNAVE, _and the other_ FARMERS _have come with their
wagons, for it is market day. Some of the wagons are drawn by horses and
some by oxen._]

NIX. Have you seen my colt, sir?

A FARMER. I saw a colt run by not long ago.

SECOND FARMER. There is a colt with Farmer Knave's oxen.

NIX. I do not see him.

THIRD FARMER. He is lying down between them.

NIX. Ah, I see him now.

(_He goes to Farmer Knave._)

I have come for my colt, Farmer Knave.

KNAVE. Your colt?

NIX. Yes. There he is between your oxen.

KNAVE. He is my colt, sir.

NIX. How can he be your colt when he is mine?

KNAVE. I ask the same question, sir.

NIX. What do you mean?

KNAVE. How can the colt be yours when he is mine?

NIX. I'll have you before the judge, sir!

KNAVE. The judge shall speak to you, sir!

[_The_ PRINCE _comes from the castle._]

PRINCE. What is all this noise, sirs? What is all this noise, I say? The
king sent me to ask.

NIX. Farmer Knave does claim my colt, Prince.

PRINCE. How is this, Farmer Knave?

KNAVE. I claim the colt because the colt is mine, Prince.

PRINCE. Now how is this, Farmer Nix?

NIX. The colt is mine, Prince.

KNAVE. The colt is mine I say!

NIX. I say the colt is mine!

PRINCE. Hush, Farmer Nix! Hush, Farmer Knave! I'll tell the king what
both of you do claim. He will decide to whom the colt belongs.

[_The Prince goes._]

KNAVE. See how the colt lies between my oxen! Is not that proof that he
is mine?

NIX. But who can tell what a colt will do?

[_The_ PRINCE _comes._]

PRINCE. Farmers, the king has decided. He says the colt belongs where it
is now lying.

KNAVE. And he lies between my oxen.

PRINCE. That is proof enough, The colt belongs to you, Farmer Knave.

NIX. But, Prince--

PRINCE. Not another word! Go, now, with your wagons and horses and oxen!
The queen comes out to walk. Go, all of you!

[_The Prince enters the castle. The farmers go, Nix last. The_ QUEEN
_and her_ LADIES _come from the castle._]

QUEEN. Go bring Farmer Nix to me.

[_A Lady runs to Nix._]

LADY. The queen wants to see you, sir.

[_Nix goes to the Queen and bows._]

QUEEN. I heard all from the castle window. I know the colt is yours.

NIX. I thank you, my Queen, I thank you!

QUEEN. Now you must show the king that colts cannot belong to oxen,
never have belonged to oxen, and never will belong to oxen.

NIX. I will go to him at once! I will tell him--

QUEEN. Not so fast! I said you must show the king. He would not let you
tell him. No one ever dares to tell things to a king.

NIX. How can I show him?

QUEEN. You must think out the way. I cannot help you more.

NIX. I thank you, my Queen, I thank you.

QUEEN. The king comes out to walk soon.

NIX. I will return to show him.

[_Nix bows to the Queen and goes. The_ KING _and_ PRINCE _come from the
castle._]

QUEEN. 'Tis a pleasant day to walk, dear King.

KING. Oh, 'tis very, very pleasant.

[_Enter_ Nix _with a fishing-net. He throws out the net and draws it
in._]

QUEEN. Why, look you what that foolish man is doing!

KING. He throws out his net and draws it in! He acts just as if he were
fishing.

QUEEN. Let's ask what he is doing.

KING. Come here, you foolish fellow! Come here, I say!

(NIX _comes to the King, but goes on with his fishing._)

Now what are you doing, sir?

[Illustration]

NIX. I am fishing, fishing, fishing.

KING. How can you fish where is no water?

NIX. Fish can be found on land if colts belong to oxen.

KING. What is that, sir?

NIX. If colts belong to oxen, then fish should swim in dust.

KING. Well, well, that may be true! What do you think, dear Queen?

QUEEN. I think with you--it may be true.

NIX (_fishing_). If colts belong to oxen, then I will always fish in
dust.

KING. Well, well, I think you may be right, sir!

(_Pause. The King thinks deeply._)

Yes, I am now sure that you are right, sir. Go get your colt from Farmer
Knave. Go with him, Prince, and see to it. Now come, dear Queen, we'll
walk about together, for 'tis a very pleasant day, 'tis very, very
pleasant.

HODGE. Well, the last tree is down!

PODGE. Down and across the road!

NODGE. Not a horse can get through them!

SCRODGE. How angry it will make the king! Ha, ha!

HODGE. He sent us word he would visit Gotham! Ha, ha!

PODGE. Ha, ha!

NODGE. Ha, ha!

SCRODGE. He would hang us if he knew we cut the trees!

HODGE. And let them fall across the road.

PODGE. He will not know. Not a Gotham man would tell him!

NODGE. Nor a Gotham woman!

SCRODGE. Nor a Gotham child!

PODGE. Everything he saw and liked, he took.

FIRST SOLDIER. Shall I bring the horses up, your Majesty?

KING. Of what use? Look how the road from here is filled with trees!

SECOND SOLDIER. Just as it was back there!

KING. I know! It was done to keep me out of Gotham! I know!

THIRD SOLDIER. Yes, your Majesty?

KING. And when I do, I'll have their noses!

THIRD SOLDIER. Yes, your Majesty.

KING. I'll have the Gotham nose of every Gotham man cut off his Gotham
face!

THIRD SOLDIER. Yes, your Majesty.

KING. Go, now, and tell them that!

THIRD SOLDIER (_saluting)._ Yes, your Majesty.

FIRST SOLDIER. We took them all away, Sire.

KING (to _a soldier._) Then go and get our horses. We will ride into
this Gotham town. (_The soldier salutes and goes._)

Where do you roll these stones, old men?

AN OLD MAN. Uphill to help the sun rise.

KING. What! To help the sun rise?

OLD MAN. Yes, your Majesty.

KING. Don't you know that the sun will rise without help?

OLD MAN. Will it? Well, well! Who would have thought of that!

KING. You foolish fellows! Well, go on and roll your stones. Now tell me
why you grunt, young men?

A YOUNG MAN. Oh, we do the grunting while our fathers do the work.

KING. Ha, ha! Well, go on and grunt. Now what are you men doing?

HODGE. There is a cuckoo here, your Majesty.

KING. What if there is a cuckoo there?

PODGE. We are building a wall around it, Sire?

KING. Why build a wall around it?

NODGE. To keep it from flying away.

KING. Ha, ha! Don't you know that the bird can fly over the wall?

HODGE. Well, well! Who would have thought of that!

NODGE. How very wise you are, Sire!

KING. You foolish fellows! Well, go on and build your wall.

(_Enter_ SCRODGE, _carrying a door on his back._)

Where are you going with that door?

SCRODGE. I am going on a journey, Sire.

KING. Why do you carry a door?

SCRODGE. I left my money at home, Sire.

KING. Why didn't you leave the door at home?

SCRODGE. I was afraid of thieves.

KING. Afraid of thieves! And you have taken down your door!

SCRODGE. If I have the door with me, they can't break it open to get in.

KING. You foolish fellow! Why didn't you leave your door at home and
carry your money?

SCRODGE. Well, well! Who would have thought of that! How very wise you
are, Sire!

KING. Now, what is this you say?

KNIGHT. I saw it all, your Majesty.

KING. You say one hundred men sit down to dine with him?

KNIGHT. Yes, your Majesty, every day.

KING. And fifty knights in velvet coats do wait on him?

KNIGHT. They bring him food on golden plates.

JESTER. Your Majesty does not eat on golden plates!

KING. I cannot afford it.

JESTER. Ha, ha! The king's Abbot lives better than the king!

KING. Be silent, Jester! Sir Knight, go bring this Abbot to me.

JESTER. The Abbot is the real king! Now who is John, ladies? Who is
John, lords? Truly, who are you, John?

[_All laugh. Enter the_ KNIGHT _and_ ABBOT.]

KING. Abbot, I hear strange things about you.

ABBOT. Your Majesty! How can that be?

KING. 'Tis said that every day you have one hundred men to dine with
you.

KING. No matter who they are!

JESTER. 'Tis not their names! 'Tis what they eat!

KING. 'Tis not your money! Everything in this land belongs to me! You
shall go to prison, sir!

so!

KING. Well, I will let you off if you will answer me two questions.

KING. First, you must tell me how long I shall live.

[_The Abbot is silent._]

JESTER. Go on, John! Ask as many as you like!

KING. Then, Abbot, you must tell me what I think.

ABBOT. Your questions, Sire, are deep and hard.

KING. Answer them, or go to prison.

ABBOT. I pray you for some time to think!

KING. I will give you just two weeks. If you cannot answer then, I'll
have your head cut off. And then I'll take your lands and palaces.

JESTER. And your knights and golden plates!

ABBOT (_in a trembling voice_). In two weeks I will return, Sire.

FIRST PROFESSOR. Go to the king and tell him all.

ABBOT. And then I'll lose my head!

SECOND PROFESSOR. Yes, I fear you'll lose your head.

FIRST PROFESSOR. I am sorry, Abbot, I wish that I might help you.

SECOND PROFESSOR. I am sorry too, friend Abbot. And I do wish the same.

ABBOT. You both have tried your best. Farewell.

(_The Professors bow and go._)

Alas! Alas! Alas! Alas!

[_Enter the_ SHEPHERD.]

SHEPHERD. Good-day to you, good Abbot!

ABBOT. Ah, Shepherd, I am glad to see you. How goes it in your village?

SHEPHERD. We do nothing there but laugh since your visit to us, sir. We
laugh all day and half the night.

ABBOT. Now why do you do that?

SHEPHERD. Because, sir, I look so much like you. At least, they think so
in our village.

ABBOT. Why, that is true, you do. Well, what can I do for you?

SHEPHERD. I have heard about the two questions, sir. I have come to help
you.

ABBOT. How can you help me? Speak!

SHEPHERD. I will go to the king in your place. He will think that I am
you.

ABBOT. Can you answer the two questions?

SHEPHERD. Only the king himself can say. Now give me your gown and cap
and golden staff, dear Abbot.

ABBOT. Well, I will let you try.

(_Gives his gown and cap to the Shepherd, who puts them on and then
takes the staff._)

You truly seem to be myself, good Shepherd!

SHEPHERD. I hope the king will think so.

ABBOT. Suppose he will not take your answers?

SHEPHERD. Then he will take my head.

ABBOT. No, good Shepherd, I'll take my own head up to him for that. Now
go, and bear my blessing with you.

[_He lifts his hand. The Shepherd bows his head._]

longer.

KING. Ha, ha! You are witty, Abbot. Now tell me what I think.

ABBOT. You think I am the Abbot, Sire. I am only his poor Shepherd.
Behold!

[_He throws off his gown and cap._]

KING. Ha, ha, ha! Truly you are a witty fellow! I like you for it, that
I do!

SHEPHERD. Then will you pardon the good Abbot, Sire?

KING. I will pardon the Abbot and let him keep his lands and knights, if
you will stay and live here in my court.

JESTER. Yes, stay. Stay and help me jest!

SHEPHERD. I'll stay, and I'll jest whene'er I can. I thank you, King
John, I thank you.

Here are your bows and arrows.

A GIRL. I'll shoot a doe!

SECOND GIRL. I'll shoot a stag with horns!

THIRD GIRL. And I, a fawn!

WOMAN. Come, Pocahontas, and get your bow and arrows.

POCAHONTAS. I will not shoot at deer!

WOMAN. Ah, but you must. The braves have gone to watch the white men.
So we must do the hunting. Come!

POCAHONTAS. I will not shoot at deer!

THIRD GIRL. She never shoots at them.

WOMAN. Why, what is this?

FOURTH GIRL. She only shoots at trees and sedges peeping from the water.

WOMAN. Now why do you not shoot at deer?

POCAHONTAS. They look at me so gently. I cannot bear to kill them.

FIRST GIRL. She will not kill anything.

SECOND GIRL. She will not even shoot a bird.

WOMAN. Can this be true?

POCAHONTAS. I will not kill the pretty things. This forest is their
home, the same as it is ours.

WOMAN. Such talk I never heard before! The braves must know of this.

POCAHONTAS. No, no! They will tell my father!

WOMAN. Aye! Chief Powhatan must know.

POCAHONTAS. I beg you not to tell him!

THIRD GIRL. He will send her from his wigwam! Do not tell him!

[Illustration: "I WILL NOT SHOOT AT DEER"]

FOURTH GIRL. He will send her alone into the forest! Do not tell him!

POCAHONTAS. Do not tell him!

WOMAN. Then take your bow and kill a deer.

POCAHONTAS. I will not! I have told you that! I cannot!

WOMAN. Powhatan shall know. Before the sun sets, Powhatan shall know.

[CAPTAIN SMITH _stands before_ POWHATAN. He _holds a small compass in
his hand._]

SMITH. Let me live, great chief! Let me live and you shall have my
talking needle!

POWHATAN. Talking needle! What is that?

SMITH. It is this needle in this box. It talks whenever I wish it.

POWHATAN. What does it say?

SMITH. It tells me where to find the north. I turn the box this way,--I
turn the box that way. But the needle always shows the north to me.

POWHATAN. Why, so it does! It is very strange and wonderful!

A BRAVE. Will it tell the north at night?

SMITH. In the darkest night it tells you.

ANOTHER BRAVE. Will it tell the north on water?

SMITH. On river or on lake it tells you.

POWHATAN. Come, show me how to make it talk.

SMITH. Will you let me go in peace?

POWHATAN. You shall live and go in peace.

MEDICINE MAN. Great chief, is it wise to let so wise a man go from us?

POWHATAN. Is it your wish to keep him here?

MEDICINE MAN. There is no place for such a wise man.

POWHATAN. What do you mean?

MEDICINE MAN. Let him go, or let him stay, he will only make more wise
things.

POWHATAN. That is true.

MEDICINE MAN. Things too wise for Powhatan's braves. Things too wise for
Powhatan.

POWHATAN. What is that? Things too wise for Powhatan!

MEDICINE MAN. The white man makes talking needles. This needle shows the
north to him. Another needle may show him how to be chief in your
place, Powhatan.

A BRAVE. Yes, yes! That is true!

ALL BRAVES. Yes, yes!

MEDICINE MAN. He is too wise to live, great chief!

BRAVES. Yes, yes, yes!

(_Pause._)

POWHATAN. Bind him to the ground, braves! Put his head on that stone
there!

SMITH. Powhatan! I beg you--

POWHATAN. Take him, braves! Be ready with your war clubs!

[_The braves throw Captain Smith on the ground, and stand over him with
uplifted clubs. Enter_ POCAHONTAS. _She runs to Captain Smith and kneels
beside him, shielding his head with her arms. Enter_ WOMEN _and_
CHILDREN.]

POCAHONTAS. You shall not kill him!

POWHATAN. My daughter! Come away!

POCAHONTAS. You shall not kill him! You shall not kill him!

A WOMAN. Pocahontas!

A GIRL. Pocahontas! They will kill you!

SECOND GIRL. Pocahontas! Come away! Come away!

POCAHONTAS. I will not move!

MEDICINE MAN. Drag her away, braves! Drag her away, I say!

POWHATAN. Do not dare to touch her! Do you hear? Do not dare to touch
her! The Great Spirit lives in the child! The Great Spirit has breathed
His courage into her! Captain Smith, you shall live and go in peace. I,
Powhatan, do say these words!

Again I ask, who among you loves the white man?

(_There is silence._)

MEDICINE MAN. The white men are not our friends, Chief Powhatan.

A BRAVE. They take our land from us.

SECOND BRAVE. They take our corn from us.

THIRD BRAVE. They will not let us fish in our own rivers.

MEDICINE MAN. They are too wise for Powhatan's children.

POWHATAN. They are too wise for Powhatan.

MEDICINE MAN. Not one should live in our great forests!

A BRAVE. We should not leave one white man in their village!

SECOND BRAVE. Nor a white woman!

THIRD BRAVE. Nor a white child!

POWHATAN. I think with you, my children. Your words are my words.

MEDICINE MAN. This night we should creep upon them!

BRAVES. Yes! Yes! Yes!

POWHATAN. This night it shall be done! Lie here and sleep, my braves,

children to the wigwams. Pocahontas, fill my quiver full of arrows. You
may do this while I sleep. And now, silence.

creeping while you sleep!

SMITH. What is this?

[ROLFE _comes from the cabin._]

ROLFE. I heard! I'll go and warn the people!

SMITH. Tell them to run quickly to the fort!

ROLFE. I'll tell them!

[_He goes, running._]

SMITH. It is brave of you to warn us, Pocahontas.

POCAHONTAS. I could not bear to have the little children killed.

SMITH. You have saved them and their mothers and their fathers. Me, you
have saved twice.

[_Pocahontas starts to go._]

POCAHONTAS. Good-by, white chief. I go now to my wigwam.

SMITH. Girl! Girl! You must not go! The braves will know you warned us!

POCAHONTAS. They will not know, white chief. At midnight they were to
leave the camp. I will get back by that time.

SMITH. It is midnight now. They have missed you by this time,
Pocahontas.

POCAHONTAS. What shall I do? What shall I do?

SMITH. You must stay with us.

POCAHONTAS. I cannot leave my father, white chief.

[_She starts to go._]

SMITH. You must not go! The braves will not let you live! I fear your
father could not save you from them!

[_Enter_ ROLFE, _running._]

ROLFE. To the fort! To the fort! The Indians are upon us! To the fort!

SMITH. Come, Pocahontas! There is our fort across the road. You will be
safe in there.

forest. They see Pocahontas and rush at her, but Rolfe shuts the
gates._]

BRAVES. Pocahontas! Pocahontas!

MEDICINE MAN. 'Tis Pocahontas who has warned them!

BRAVES. Yes, yes! 'Tis Pocahontas!

MEDICINE MAN. Do you hear that, Chief Powhatan?

POWHATAN. I hear.

POWHATAN. Go, take the peace flag to them, and ask for Pocahontas.

[_The_ MEDICINE MAN _raises a white flag and goes to the fort. Captain
Smith and many men come out._]

SMITH. Do you come to offer peace?

MEDICINE MAN. We offer peace, great chief, if you will give up
Pocahontas.

SMITH. And what if we will not give her up?

MEDICINE MAN. We will make war upon you.

SMITH. We will not give her up.

MEDICINE MAN. Then not a man of you shall live! Nor a woman! Nor a
child!

SMITH. Pocahontas is our friend. We will not give her up to you.

MEDICINE MAN. Shoot them, braves! Shoot them, as they stand there!

POWHATAN. Do not dare to shoot one arrow! I, Powhatan, speak.

(_To Smith._)

I see you are my daughter's friend, white chief.

SMITH. I am, and would be yours, if you would let me.

POWHATAN. Your white braves take our land from us.

SMITH. They shall pay you. As I am chief here, they shall pay you.

POWHATAN. Your white braves take our corn from us. They will not let us
fish in our own rivers.

SMITH. I did not know such wrongs were done you. My braves shall pay for
everything in full.

POWHATAN. Then there shall be peace between us. Bring the peace pipe,
braves. We will smoke in friendship with our brothers.

SMITH. And Pocahontas will be pardoned? You will take her back as your
own daughter?

POWHATAN. Pocahontas will be pardoned, white chief. She shall come and
go, as she may please, between our wigwams and yours, my brother.

_[A brave comes with the peace pipe, which he gives to Powhatan, who
hands it to Captain Smith._]

SMITH (_taking pipe_). 'Tis for eternal peace between us!




KING ALFRED AND THE CAKES

[Footnote: The teacher should explain that King Alfred was one of the
most famous and best beloved kings of England, and that while he was
king the Danes were trying to conquer England. At the time of the story,
he had been defeated by the Danes, and was compelled to hide with a few
followers in the forest to avoid falling into the hands of the enemy.]


TIME: _More than a thousand years ago._

[_A hut is at one side. Near by is a pile of burning fagots. The_ PRINCE
_enters from the forest. He carries a great spear. He looks about;
creeps to the hut and looks in the window; shows satisfaction; returns
to the forest._]

PRINCE (_softly_). All is well. Enter!

(_Enter_ Two ENGLISH SOLDIERS _from forest. They carry large bows and
wear quivers holding arrows._)

We are safe here, my men. Tell King Alfred that.

[_The first Soldier salutes and enters forest._]

SECOND SOLDIER. Danes may hide in the hut, Prince--

PRINCE (_shaking head_). There's only an old woman within.

[_Enter_ FIRST SOLDIER. _He holds the bushes and vines aside._]

FIRST SOLDIER. The king!

[_Enter_ KING ALFRED. _He is disguised as a beggar. He is young, manly,
and courageous._]

PRINCE (_bowing)._ You can rest safely here, King Alfred.

KING. Do you think the Danes are still in pursuit?

PRINCE. No, your Majesty, I am sure we have escaped them this time.

SECOND SOLDIER. Besides, they would not know your Majesty dressed so.

KING (_anxiously_). Gentlemen, disguise yourselves as you have me.

PRINCE. That will not do, Sire. The Danes must not see you dressed as we
are. 'Twill make you safer.

KING. Aye, but there's more danger for you dressed so. Come, be beggars
now with me!

FIRST SOLDIER (_shaking head_). Our first thought is for you, Sire.

SECOND SOLDIER. Should you fall into the Danes' hands now, what will
become of England?

KING. Why, she must fight again!

PRINCE, (_shaking head_). Our soldiers ran from the Danes to-day, and
lost the battle to them!

KING. 'Tis because they fear these Danes as they do monsters,--monsters
come to rob them,--to burn their homes,--to make them slaves!

SOLDIERS. Aye! Aye!

KING. If only I could turn their fear to rage and fierce, hot anger!
Then England would not flee! She'd fight her foes and conquer!

SOLDIERS. Aye! Aye!

PRINCE. 'Tis for that great work you should save yourself, Sire! For
that, you should wear the beggar's rags now!

[_Enter_ ENGLISH SOLDIERS _in great haste._]

THIRD SOLDIER. Sire, save yourself! The Danes still follow us!

FOURTH SOLDIER. They have crossed the river!

THIRD SOLDIER. They pursue your Majesty!

PRINCE. Go to the hut there, Sire. Let the Danes find you begging from
the goodwife.

KING. But you, my men, where will you hide?

FIRST SOLDIER. We'll scatter, Sire.

KING. Then go, go at once! I'll await you here, if the Danes go on.

PRINCE (_saluting_). Farewell, my King!

SOLDIERS (_saluting_). Farewell, King Alfred, farewell!

[_They go. The King crosses to hut, and knocks at door, which is opened
by the_ GOODWIFE. _She holds a wooden bowl and a large flat stone in her
hands._]

GOODWIFE (_aside_). Another beggar, as I live!

(_Aloud, sharply_). Well, what do you want?

KING. A bite to eat, goodwife.

GOODWIFE. My cakes are not yet baked.

KING. I will wait, then.

GOODWIFE (_indignantly_). Well, and you will not, sir!

KING (_alarmed_). You will not drive me off, good woman!

GOODWIFE. And who are you, that you should sit by and wait, whilst I do
all the work! And do you think you are the king, sir?

KING. No, no! I--

GOOD WIFE (_interrupting_). You'll fry the cakes yourself, sir! And that
you will at once, sir! Go now and mend the fire, and lay this stone upon
it.

[_The King takes the stone; crosses to the fire, and stirs it; places
the stone on the burning wood. When the stone is hot, the Goodwife pours
the batter from the bowl on the stone._]

GOODWIFE. Now watch these cakes while I'm within. And watch them well:
rye cakes do burn while one is winking.

KING. I'll watch them carefully, goodwife.

(_The Goodwife enters hut. The King turns the cakes carefully, then sits
on a log; he shows that his thoughts are far away._)

I _will_ drive them out! I _will!_

(_Pause._)

To-night I'll get my men together.

(_Pause._)

We will take them by surprise--at daybreak.

[_Enter the_ GOODWIFE; _she rushes to the fire._]

GOOD WIFE (_looking at cakes_). Burnt to cinders! Not one of them fit
to eat!

KING. I am sorry--I--

GOOD WIFE (_interrupting)._ Oh, you good-for-nothing! I would like to
beat you!

KING. What can I do to make it right?

GOODWIFE (_taking up a stick_). You'll mix more dough! More dough! Do
you hear?

KING. I'll be glad to do it, Madam!

GOODWIFE (_flourishing stick_). In with you! Now in with you, and get to
work!

[_The King enters the hut. Enter_ DANISH CHIEF _and_ DANES _from the
forest. They carry spears and shields._]

GOODWIFE (_with fear; dropping stick_). The Danes!

CHIEF (_haughtily)._ Aye, Danes!

GOODWIFE. I have no silver! Not a piece, sir!

CHIEF. Burn the hut, men!

DANES. Aye! Aye!

[_They start toward the hut. The Goodwife falls on her knees before
them._]

GOODWIFE. I pray you, spare my home!

[Illustration: "NOT ONE OF THEM FIT TO EAT!"]

CHIEF. We spare no home to any English. Do you not know that?

GOODWIFE. I've heard so--

FIRST DANE. We'll burn every home on English land before we go!

SECOND DANE. And drive every Englishman into the seas!

DANES. Aye! Aye!

GOODWIFE (_sobbing)._ I pray you--

CHIEF (_roughly)._ Come, get up! Get up and cease your weeping! I like
it not. Get up, I say!

[_Goodwife rises, trembling with fear._]

CHIEF. Now listen; we will not burn your hut, if you will tell us what
we wish to know.

GOODWIFE. I will tell you what I can--

CHIEF. Did King Alfred pass this way in flight?

GOODWIFE (_starting_). What? Our king in flight?

CHIEF (_angrily_). Come, no tears for him! Did he pass this way, I say?

GOODWIFE. No, my lord.

FIRST DANE. Do not believe her, chief! There's not an Englishman that
would not hide him from us!

GOODWIFE (_forgetting her fear_). Aye, and die for him!

CHIEF (_angrily)._ Say not such words to me! I am your king that is to
be!

DANES. Aye! Aye!

CHIEF. Go search within the hut, Danes!

[_Danes enter hut. They come out immediately bringing King Alfred._]

FIRST DANE. We found this man within, chief.

SECOND DANE. 'Tis only her husband, I think.

GOODWIFE (_indignantly_). _Husband_, say you?--that beggar!

CHIEF (_showing suspicion_). Ah, a beggar--!

GOODWIFE. Yes, my lord, he came but just before you.

FIRST DANE (_whispering_). Hear that, my lord,--just before us!

SECOND DANE (_whispering_). It may be King Alfred!

THIRD DANE (_whispering_). Disguised as a beggar, sir!

FOURTH DANE (_whispering_). 'Twould be safest to take him prisoner, my
lord!

CHIEF (_nodding_). We'll take him with us to be certain.

GOODWIFE (_hearing this_). Yes, take him! 'Twould serve him right! He
burnt my cakes just now!

CHIEF. What! Burnt your cakes?

GOODWIFE. Yes, my lord! And I'd have beaten him had not your lordship
come.

CHIEF (_aside to Danes_). This cannot be the king.

FIRST DANE (_shaking head_). No king would fry cakes!

SECOND DANE (_shaking head_). He could not be made to fry them!

THIRD DANE (_shaking head_). Nor take a beating from a woman!

[_The Goodwife has crept up to listen; and so overhears this last
remark._]

GOODWIFE. He wouldn't, eh? Ha, ha! Well, I sent him within to mix fresh
dough! And I sent him with my stick, I did!

[_Flourishing stick._]

FOURTH DANE. Would you let a woman threaten you with a stick, my lord?

CHIEF (_proudly)._ Never! Besides, King Alfred would be dressed as are
his princes and his soldiers. I have thought that from the first.
Release the beggar!

[_Danes release King Alfred._]

CHIEF. Now listen, Danes! A hundred silver pieces will I give the man
who makes King Alfred prisoner! Hear--all of you!--One hundred silver
pieces!

DANES. Aye! Aye!

CHIEF (_to Goodwife and Alfred_). And when this Alfred's taken, to me
you'll bend your English knees! To me, you English beggar! Now come, my
men! To hunt King Alfred!

DANES (_going_). To hunt King Alfred! To hunt King Alfred!

[_They go. King Alfred smiles. The Goodwife looks after them, listening
for a moment._]

GOODWIFE. May they never see a hair of his head!

(_Lifting up arms._)

May Heaven protect and save King Alfred!

KING (_growling_). You seem to love King Alfred--

GOODWIFE. I love the ground he treads on!

KING (_as before_). Of course,--'tis English ground!

GOODWIFE (_shaking head_). Not that--I love the air he breathes!

KING. Well--'tis English air.

GOODWIFE (_sharply)._ No, no! I love the king!--the king himself!

KING (_growling)._ Out upon King Alfred! Out upon him, I say!

GOODWIFE (_angrily)._ You are a traitor, sir!

KING. What has he done for England? He has lost every battle to the
Danes! He is running from them now!

GOODWIFE. 'Tis no fault of his! If the king's men were as brave as he,
there would not be a Dane on English land to-day!

KING (_still growling_). Well, I'm glad there's one that thinks so well
of him!

GOODWIFE. You are a traitor and should be punished!

(_Taking up stick._)

I myself will do it!

[_Lifting stick. Enter the_ PRINCE _and_ ENGLISH SOLDIERS.]

PRINCE (_kneeling_). Your Majesty is safe!

GOOD WIFE (_aside_). What!--Your Majesty, they say!

SOLDIERS (_kneeling, joyfully_). King Alfred! King Alfred!

GOODWIFE (_aside)._ What!--King Alfred!--

KING. Rise, my Prince! Rise, my soldiers! Ah, I'm glad they did not find
you!

[_He grasps their hands._]

GOODWIFE (_aside; showing fear_). It is--it is--the king!

KING. We'll fight again, my men! At daybreak we'll surprise them.

SOLDIERS. Aye! Aye!

KING. Goodwife, your king now thanks you.

GOODWIFE (_kneeling_). Oh, your Majesty, forgive me! forgive me!

KING (_gently_). Arise, goodwife.

GOODWIFE (_rising_). Alas the day I made you fry the cakes! Alas the day
I would have beaten you!

KING. Nay, goodwife, 'twas that saved my life. I bless the day you made
me fry the cakes! I bless the day you would have beaten me! (_Lifting
his hand over her head._)

And you I bless, goodwife, for your loyalty to England and her king!
Soldiers, salute this brave goodwife!

[_Soldiers form in a double line from door of hut, and hold their bows
aloft to make an arch. The Goodwife passes up this lane, under the bows,
and stands in door of hut. The King and the Prince salute her._]
