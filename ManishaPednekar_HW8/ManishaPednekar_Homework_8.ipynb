The movies I chose to create this movie review dataset are Cars 3, Toy Story 4, The Grinch and Aladdin. I created a .csv file named “clusterDf” in HW7 from the output of k-means clustering. It contains the following 7 columns: **Movie Name, User rating, review title, review text, Full text Combining title and text, Label based on user rating (positive/ negative) and Cluster# (0 to 3).** Here I am loading this .csv file from the movie reviews clustering HW 7 assignment.\n",

I tried Sarkar books code assigned for this course, but it had a lot of legacy code (Python 2 code) to repair. Thus, I used Sarkar's book called \"Practical machine learning with Python\". This code needs 2 supporting python files (text_normalizer.py, contractions.py) to run.\n",

For each cluster, the means and medians of sentiments scores are aligned with the corresponding *means and medians* of review User ratings. The means of the sentiment scores are more aligned means of the ratings than min, median or max measures. Thus, we can conclude that “sentiwordnet\" lexicon library can be used successfully for this set of reviews despite the very small size of the corpus used for sentiment analysis task.\n"
