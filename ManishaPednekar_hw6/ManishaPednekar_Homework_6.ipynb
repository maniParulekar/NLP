    "I searched the book with the phrase **\"emperor of all maladies\"** in Amazon book search interface. The complete book name is **\"The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer\"** and this title is matched the most with the **search number 15 \"The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer (Chinese Edition)\" with score of 0.744**. The only difference between these 2 book titles is that the two words added at the end as \"(Chinese Edition)\" of the exact book title selected, thus these scores seem relevant as per the words of the matched title. We used TF-IDF formula while calculating cosine similarity which make it weighs down the frequent words and I think that is the reason that the book title is more similar with this \"The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer (Chinese Edition)\" with score 0.744 than \"The Emperor of All Maladies by Siddhartha Mukherjee - Key Takeaways & Analysis: A Biography of Cancer\" with score 0.568. The book with **lowest cosine similarity score of 0.0 is the search number 18 with book title \"The Best American Science and Nature Writing 2013 (The Best American Series)\". This result of lowest cosine score of this title which have too generic words like science, nature, best with the original title seems correct knowing that the TF-IDF formula used while calculating cosine similarity.** "
