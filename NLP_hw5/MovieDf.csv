Cars 3 a has a few major problems. - We don't want to live in or know about whatever 'new reality' this movie has created, where Lightning isn't the fastest car anymore. We especially don't want to know that there is an entire new generation of cars that are faster than him. How depressing is that. - The movie has very little of the heart, soul, and humor of the original. It has a very different feel, with the 'next gen' cars speaking and acting like spoilt millennials. Jackson Storm is a nasty piece of work. - If feels like the point of the movie is to reinforce that 'girls can do anything' (like most movies these days). That's all well and good, but it's not what we paid money to actually go and see. We want to watch a movie about the movie's actual hero and main character, Lightning Mcqueen.

A new toy named Forky(Tony Hale), joins Woody & the others. A road trip with old & new toys shows how massive the world can be, for a toy.

Toy Story 4 is a mind-blowing film. Director Josh Cooley has wonderfully brought us a very unique & unforgettable Toy Story movie, after the superlative Toy Story(1995), Toy Story 2(1999) & Toy Story 3(2010). I was skeptical when I first found out that Pixar was making this film. Toy Story 3(2010) was the perfect conclusion to this franchise. However, I stand corrected. Toy Story 4 fantastically wraps up the adventures of Woody, Buzz, Jessie & the rest of the gang. The animation is top-notch. The 3D is eye-popping. The humor & emotional scenes, have been perfectly balanced throughout. The vocal performances are the highlight of the movie. Tom Hanks is spectacular as Woody. Tim Allen is great as Buzz Lightyear. Annie Potts is outstanding as Bo Peep. Tony Hale is hysterical as Forky. Keegan-Michael Key & Jordan Peele are amazing as Ducky & Bunny, respectively. Christina Hendricks is excellent as Gabby Gabby. Keanu Reeves is hilarious as Duke Caboom. Ally Maki is good as Giggle McDimples. Joan Cusack is incredible as Jessie. Madeleine McGraw, Jay Hernandez & Lori Alan are superb as Bonnie, her dad & mom, respectively. The supporting cast is good. Toy Story 4 is a must watch for all Toy Story fans & families. This franchise goes to infinity & beyond!","A fitting finale to the Toy Story franchise, we didn't know we needed."
positive,Toy Story 4,/review/rw4962561/,10,"Having seen all Toy Story movies in movie theatres since I was 10, and having been under the impression that at the end of every movie it was the proper ending, Toy Story 4 was one I wasn't going to miss seeing first thing on opening night, and it did not disappoint one bit!

Woody comes to terms with no longer being ""top toy"" and learns there are other ways to support and help a child, various female role models are strengthened in their portrayal and sometimes things that seem selfish can in fact be done for a goal that are entirely selfless.

All in all, PIXAR has once again created a movie that ticks off all boxes a movie could possible have to offer an audience of all ages, with a rich story presenting layered characters in dazzling graphics.",The most noble thing a toy could do

This instalment is all about the toys with familiar much loved characters such as Woody and Buzz, and some excellent new characters such as Duke Caboom and Forky.

As normal, there are plenty of wholesome moral messages about belonging, purpose, loyalty and moving on, all written with humour to be digestible for both the kids and adults in the audience. Some scary scenes involving stylised butler puppets and emotional scenes toward the end.

Stay in your seats for some equally hilarious post credit scenes. Very highly recommended (an easy maximum score).","Ts4 - belonging, purpose, loyalty & moving on"
positive,Toy Story 4,/review/rw4954816/,10,"Introduction: Like many people, I thought this film would be the weakest in the series, and a pointless sequel. But man, I was wrong. We were all wrong. From the first trailer, I thought it would have been disappointing, like I was with 'Incredibles 2', but I can say with much confidence, that 'Toy Story 4' was another satisfying entry in the 'Toy Story' series.

The Story: After the third film, me, like any other thought there was nowhere else to go with the series. As it felt like the perfect final chapter. However, it turns out you could still expand the story. As the writers thought of a perfect ending to the story of Woody. As in the film, Woody feels as if he doesn't belong, as cowboy doll is likely to not get the attention a little girl. Which leads to a satisfying ending to his arc. Not only that, but this is probably the most mature film in the series, as it deals with themes of independence, and being loved. The film also has very good comedic writing, in my opinion. This film is a logical progression of the story of the 'Toy Story' trilogy.

My only real issues with the story, is the fact that the other characters take a lot more a backseat than the other movies. However, this is Woody's movie, so I should expect it to not focus on them. And it is only a small criticism I have with the film's story.

The Characters: Both the new and old characters are either, just as good as they were in the previous films, and the new characters are nice additions to the 'Toy Story' series. They all go through a logical progression and grow as the film goes on, and the same thing goes for the new characters.

Animation: Like the previous films, the animation is just as good, and true Pixar level 3D animation. Of course the good animation quality is gonna be good, it's Pixar. But I still felt it's something to praise.

Conclusion: In conclusion, this film is an entertaining watch, a logical progression of the story, and a surprisingly satisfying film. It was worth the 9 year wait, and I loved this movie as much as the other films in the franchise. And some of Pixar's best work.",And I Thought This Film Would Suck...
positive,Toy Story 4,/review/rw4951785/,10,"What a perfect way to end the franchise, it has fantastic animation, likeable and funny characters (like Duke Caboom, and ducky and bunny) my only problem would be is you don't spend enough time with the old characters as much as the new ones.",The toys are back in action.
positive,Toy Story 4,/review/rw4963493/,10,"Toy Story 4 was brought to us by new director Josh Cooley and, as the title implies, is the 4th installment of the Toy Story film franchise. Sometime after the events of the first film, Bonnie begins kindergarten and crafts a toy named Forky. Forky doesn't know his place in the world, so Woody attempts to show him the ropes and teach him what being a toy is like. While doing so, the two are separanted from Bonnie and the rest of the toys, where Woody learns more about the life of a toy.

I went into this movie cautiously and with high expectations because at first glance, this movie feels like a cash-grab. The previous film ended the franchise perfectly, and seeing a fourth on its way, I felt baffled. Leaving the theater, I was beyond emotionally satisfied, and pleasantly surprised with it!

On the surface, this movie is consistently hilarious. Every joke had me and the audience laughing. There are many different running gags present throughout the movie that really work both comedically, and through a storytelling point of view. Forky has a running joke where he throws himself in trash cans, which I found hilarious, and the joke didn't overstay its welcome. Ducky and Bunny are two characters played by comedy duo Key and Peele, and they're easily the funniest aspect of the entire film. They have hilarious one-liners and fantasies that had the audience bursting out laughing for long periods of time. The abundance of comedy here is also an indication that this entry is far more lighthearted than the previous one.

Toy Story 4 also surprised me with how well it appeals to its adult audiences much like the previous entries. It has some intersting commentary on advertisement, loyalty and products that are considered faulty. Like the previous films, it also explores aspects of life. Where the previous three looked at redundancy, retirement and death, this film looks at independence. I found it to be a very interesting take on the matter that has had me thinking about said aspect since I left the theater. I really enjoyed seeing Bo Peep again, as she brings some nice surprised to the table. I thought Gabby Gabby was an interesting villain, especially as we learn about her in-depth and about her true intentions. The movie also has its emotional moments, and they're present the most throughout the last 20 minutes. It has its moments that are both very heartwarming and have the ability to make you cry.

I was really surprised to see that Toy Story 4 eceeded my expectations and gave us a fourth movie to the beloved Toy Story franchise that feels fresh and worthy of being part of the franchise. My only complaints for this movie are just nitpicks, so why should I care when the rest of the movie goes to infinity and beyond to make a phenomenal film?

10/10","Emotional, funny and heartfelt, Toy Story 4 goes to infinity and beyond to prove its worth as a part of the franchise."
positive,Toy Story 4,/review/rw4958807/,10,NA,Awesome conclusion
positive,Toy Story 4,/review/rw4947775/,10,"Toy Story 4 is directed by Josh Cooley, you may recognize him from Inside Out, he was one of the writers, and it's his first full length feature movie. Writing Credits: John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, Josh Cooley, Valerie LaPointe, Rashida Jones, Will McCormack, Martin Hynes, Stephany Folsom.. (original story), Andrew Stanton and Stephany Folsom.. (screenplay). And starring: Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Annie Potts and Joan Cusack, besides some new members like Tony Hale as Forky, Keegan-Michael Key as Ducky, Jordan Peele as Bunny, Keanu Reeves as Duke Caboom and Christina Hendricks as Gabby Gabby.

Woody (voice of Tom Hanks) has always been confident about his place in the world, and that his priority is taking care of his kid, whether that's Andy or Bonnie. So when Bonnie's beloved new craft-project-turned-toy, Forky (voice of Tony Hale), declares himself as ""trash"" and not a toy, Woody takes it upon himself to show Forky why he should embrace being a toy. But when Bonnie takes the whole gang on her family's road trip excursion, Woody ends up on an unexpected detour that includes a reunion with his long-lost friend Bo Peep (voice of Annie Potts). After years of being on her own, Bo's adventurous spirit and life on the road belie her delicate porcelain exterior. As Woody and Bo realize they're worlds apart when it comes to life as a toy, they soon come to find that's the least of their worries.

I'm a huge fan of the Toy Story saga, I loved all the predecessors, I think Toy Story 3 is one of the best movies of all time, and the first Toy Story movie is one of the best comedies of all time.. also Toy Story 2 -as lots of people agreed, myself included- is one of the best sequels of all time! I thought TS3 has the best conclusion to this amazing saga, and I didn't expect a TS4 at all, and when they announced it, I had no clue how this movie will go after the amazing emotional conclusion we had in TS3... Untill the trailer that I really loved, but I also THOUGHT that it showed too much, why did I say it like that? 'Cause I was wrong, and everyone who thinks that the trailer showed too much, I respect your opinion, but it didn't.. at all! I don't wanna spoil anything until everyone gets to see this masterpiece in theaters, but I'd say that the trailer misguided us, in a perfect way, don't get me wrong.

Okay, where do I start?... Let's start with how people was truly trashing this movie, before even the trailer! I mean I understand that people were afraid, but at least give it a chance.. I guess now they would, because the movie got some pretty serious amazing reviews everywhere.. and I'm so happy, cause this movie is a blast, I was totally blown away of how well-made this movie is! From the cinematography to the funny scenes, to the score, the animation, the new crew, characters -old and new-, the emotional beats to the conclusion, maybe.. we still don't know if it's the last or not, but they gonna make it as wonderful as the saga is, go on, I'm in!!

Let's talk about the cinematography, it's Josh Cooley's very first full feature movie, and I was concerned a little bit, because John Lasseter did an amazing job with the first two, and Lee Unkrich was magnificent also, he did a fascinating job with the third one. So did Josh Cooley with TS4, every scene was just beautifully directed, with a great animation... Actually, TS4 has the best animation of ALL TIME, Pixar really did an amazing job with this saga, from the very first CGI animated movie, to a very great improvement, to the best of the recent time, until TS4.. the best so far.... It never was that realistic before, even Incredibles 2 wasn't that amazing.. this is the animation of the decade, every shot felt SO REAL!!!!

The score was amazing.. again! As a comedy, this movie made me cry from laughing like 3 or 4 times, and all the rest of the movie was really funny too! People were actually asking if they have to bring some tissues with them, I'd say.. yeah, bring a lot, cause my theater was wiping, I lost it even more than I did in TS3.. it has a very good emotional conclusion and I loved it! The plot, is really cool, no spoilers, it's just.. surprising.. go with no mentality and have fun with it, cause whenever you feel like it's another episodic Toy Story movie -as the trailer showed us- the movie won't stop surprising you!

The new members were really great.. Bunny and Ducky are really funny, Forky, the one that I was really thinking that he's going to annoy me, he was great, really sweet and cute, and of course adds a lot to the movie. Duke Caboom is amazing, it's a great role for Keanu Reeves, there's a story behind him, I felt it was unnecessary, but it helps the movie somehow.

As flaws, finally.. in this year, I found none.. this is a perfect flawless movie, the one and only so far that really deserves the highest grade, best movie of the year so far, but I don't think that something is gonna surpass it actually, to be honest.

Toy Story 4 is NOT just another Toy Story movie, it has a great message to EVERYONE, so emotional, funny and beautifully animated and directed, Toy Story 4 of course gets an A+!

The writing remains top-notch, exploring thought-provoking dilemmas that have the protagonists (and audience) often second-guessing themselves and make the villains and their motivations understandable and investing. I also found 4 to be the funniest of the series. Forky, Ducky and Bunny (played by Tony Hale from Arrested Development, Key and Peele, respectively) are the comedic highlights; I was legitimately laughing out loud at their dialogue and antics. Toy Story 4 is far from the cash grab many thought it would be. It's sharply written, beautifully animated and brings the series to an emotionally satisfying conclusion. What a journey.","A sharply written, beautifully animated sendoff..."
positive,Toy Story 4,/review/rw4952307/,10,"Toy Story 4.... a sequel that nobody asked for after how perfect the ending was to Toy Story 3, now I love The Toy Story series, it's always been the most perfect movie trilogy ever, clever, funny, meaningful, the animation is revolutionary, wonderful characters and so much more, this is what made Pixar who they are today, so I was quite scared for a fourth movie, I mean what else can you do with these characters?, instead of John Lassiter and Lee Unkrich, it's now Josh Cooley as the director of this new adventure with Woody and the gang, Pixar was nice bough to release it in the UK the same day as the US, I saw it on the 22nd of June, successfully avoiding spoilers and...... wow, this series of films just get better and better, so let's talk about it.

While at Kindergarten, Bonnie who is now the new owner of Andy's toys, with Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz (Tim Allen), Jesse (Joan Cusack) and many more, she creates this character named Forky (Tony Hale) using arts and crafts materials, Forky may seem like a innocent toy, but he thinks he's not a toy, he thinks he is considered trash, so Woody has to stop him from going into the garbage, it makes it worse since Bonnie and his family are taking a vacation, Woody and Forky get lost, they end up in a antic shop, where Forky has been help captive by Gabby Gabby who is a creepy doll that has been in the shop for a long time, so Woody has to find him and get him back to Bonnie, now... where do I begin?, first off this is a really well crafted story, it has messages and themes throughout the entire movie just like the other movies, but the themes here are more meaningful and it can connect and relate to those who find the themes in the movie amazing, it is also funny, lots of clever humour and funny moments sprinkled throughout, it still has the same amount of heart that it always had, it's touching and especially emotional towards the end (don't worry, I won't give anything away), it's entertaining throughout and it put a big grin on my face, it had a lot of amazing ideas put into it as well and... the ending, It's such a heartbreaking and super sad ending that yes.... I cried, I cried with tears coming down my face, a popular example of a sad ending was Avengers: Endgame, I didn't cry at Endgame personally, but this movie.... this movie still had me thinking and I was still emotional after seeing it, the Pixar team did the best they could with the material that they got, they created a fantastically well put together plot, with strong writing, great humour, entertainment, wonderful heart and a really tear jerking ending that is a wonderful way to end the saga.

The animation is just unbelievable, Pixar has come along way with their animation, the first movie's animation was groundbreaking and new, they improved film by film, but here they really outdone themselves, this attention to detail in the animation is just incredible, each character has a wonderful design to them, the new characters look especially interesting, with Forky being the best looking character with what he can do, the backgrounds are photo realistic and beautiful, it's got great character animation and movement to it, when it comes to the fair ground, there's colour and beauty to it, the antic shop is old and grey but also somewhat scary, it has amazing lighting and cinematography to it, not much else to say but a visual achievement by a incredible animation studio, they went from groundbreaking animation, to mind blowing and jaw dropping animation, this is why Pixar is amazing at that they do.

The characters are truly wonderful, old and new, Woody is a even more fleshed out character then before, there's More purpose to him, he has a goal and hard choices to choose in the course of this movie, but still charming and loveable as ever, Buzz is still the loyal friend to Woody who would always help him whenever he needs it, Jessie is still a entertaining and likeable character, in fact the rest of the supporting characters from the other movies like Hamm, Rex, Slinky, Bullseye, Mr. And Mrs. Potato head are still funny and entertaining, the toys that Bonnie have are also the same, Bo Beep returns and is even better then she was before, her chemistry with Woody is wonderful and funny, now for the new characters, there's Forky who's charming, funny and plays a somewhat big part in the movie, Gabby Gabby was one character I didn't expect to love, but she was great, there's more to her then you would expect, Bunny and Ducky are really funny supporting characters, Duke Ca-Boom is a lot of fun, not only are the characters just amazing, same can apply to the voice acting, Tom Hanks is just incredible as Woody, Tim Allen is amazing as Buzz, Joan Cusack is wonderful as Jesse, everyone from the previous movies are amazing, the new characters have great voice actors too, Tony Hale is charming as Forky, Christina Hendricks is quite intense as Gabby Gabby, Key and Peele are funny as Bunny and Ducky, Keanu Reeves is surprisingly great as Duke Ca-Boom, the characters fully represent what it's like to be a toy, they have humour, heart, entertainment, whit, charm and great voice actors behind them, it's what make them truly a wonderful group of toys.

Wow......, this series feels completed now, after Toy Story 3 I didn't know how the fourth movie was going to top it, but it found a way and it did it in a amazing way, Toy Story 4 is a strong Pixar movie with incredible writing, animation that is mind boggling, characters with humour, heart and purpose along with terrific voice acting, Josh Cooley did a amazing job directing this movie, now... there is NO and I repeat NO need for a fifth movie because there is nothing else you can do with these characters, so I just want to say.... Pixar, thank you, thank you for all the good times with these characters, they made me laugh, they made me cry, they are always fun and entertaining, the movies have been incredible and moving, not one bad bit of filmmaking, but like all good things, it might come to an end and this ended off with something truly powerful and perfect, Toy Story 3 started the decade off in 2010 and now the fourth movie is ending the decade off, so it has been fun being with these characters and their adventures, we don't need anymore adventures, we have what we need for a saga... or should I say the best saga ever!..... so for that I want a big heartfelt and honest thank you to Pixar, I will continue to watch and support what you make and I do hope... that you continue to do more amazing stuff, hopefully Onward and Soul will be amazing also, so it's been fun but we made it to Infinity and Beyond...

positive,Toy Story 4,/review/rw4950351/,10,"Like many movie lovers who grew up in the 1990s, Toy Story was one of the staples of childhood when it came to watching films. After the release of Toy Story 2 in 1999, many believed the franchise had ended, until a third film came along over ten years later. Really putting a capper on the Toy Story story as fans knew it from the beginning, Toy Story 3 was a definitive conclusion. So why was a third instalment even in the works? Until the release of the movie, that was the question on many viewers' minds. Personally, upon the initial announcement a few years back, I was against this movie, but I've loved these films since the beginning, so of course, I was going to check this one out, and I'm glad that I did. Toy Story 4 has earned a worthy place in the franchise in my eyes.

Picking up pretty soon after the events of the third film, we now see how our favourite, loveable toys have moved on from their previous owner (Andy) and how they've settled in with their new one in Bonnie. Without getting into the specifics of how or why a new toy (Forky) is introduced, I'll just simply state that Bonnie builds him at school and he miraculously comes to life, giving Woody a new job, so to speak. The plot really kicks into gear, However, when Forky is thrust onto the street during a family vacation, and the Woody/Forky excursion begins. Each toy has a moment to shine, but this truly is a film about Woody.

I could immediately dive into negatives and say that Buzz Lightyear doesn't have enough screen time or that reference and lines of dialogue from previous movies are slightly repeated too much throughout the duration of the movie, but that would just be me complaining about an otherwise near-perfect animated film. I had nitpicks here and there while watching the movie, but I just have to be honest and say the overall movie surrounding those inner quarrels were just scratches on a canvas that was painted beautifully as a whole.

As always, the animation is astounding and life-like at times, which feels a little funny when comparing it to how simple the animation was in the original film, so the movie was beautiful to look at. On top of that, this is a film filled with heart, that cares about its characters, and even takes the time to introduce many new, memorable faces along the way. From Ducky and Bunny to Duke Caboom, these new characters will actually remain in my mind as memorable side characters, which is what many sequels fail to do these days.

In the end, fans of the first three movies are more than likely going to love watching this instalment, newcomers will get a fresh story now that a previous chapter has been closed, and fans of comedy will also get many clever laughs here as well. I'm not ready to call Toy Story 4 my favourite film of the franchise by any means, but in terms of character progression, emotion, and an overall extremely enjoyable film, I would be lying if I didn't say that I loved it. Yes, I have minor issues, but they are so small that I just feel like giving this one a perfect grade, which I haven't given to many films in 2019. Toy Story 4 is a wonderful time at the movies and I highly recommend it.",A Worthy Addition to the Franchise

It felt the like the final chapter had closed and that there didn't need to be another film. Not to mention that after having created what is generally considered one of the strongest film trilogies ever made, Pixar would be tempting the fates by creating another one. But they did it! Toy Story 4 is an utterly entertaining film.

This film's feel seems to be created to directly contrast with 3. Whereas the last movie was darker and felt stretched out, this film feels more lighthearted and fluidly compact. This is the installment that is trying the most to have fun.

Don't consider this purely a frivolous film. The ending is almost as strong as in the last movie, and I felt that one was only better only by a thin margin. Things get pretty emotional.

The entire film is about Woody (Tom Hanks) having an existential crisis. Once a favorite plaything and the leader of Andy's toys, Woody is now one of his new owner's least played with toys and being a newcomer, no longer the leader. His whole journey is pretty compelling.

The biggest reason this movie justifies it's existence is that not only do we have closure for Bo Beep (Ghostbuster's Annie Potts), but her character is finally given justice. In the original film, it seems she was part of the cast just because they needed at least a couple female characters. Her role didn't serve much purpose other than to be Woody's girlfriend. Same with the sequel. You could've cut the character out, and it wouldn't affect anything. Then, in number three, she was just out of the story entirely, having already been sold to a new owner. The writer's reasoning at the time was that due to the heavy action scenes, I'm guessing primarily the moments where the toys are roughed up by toddlers, Bo Beep being porcelain and fragile was difficult to include. Here she's finally give her due. She has more personality, she has agency, and she is finally part of the action and story.

New character Forky (voiced by Veep and Arrested Development's Alan Hale) is an inspired creation, a handicraft toy made out of a spork who's dealing with sudden sentience. He works well interacting with Woody as they share questions about their existence in the world. I actually felt the character was underutilized a bit. (It did annoy me a little that the writers were selective about how much or little knowledge of the world Sporky had.)

The new villain Gabby Gabby (Christina Hendricks) is yet another emotionally damaged toy. Don't worry about her being a clone of the last two. They go down a refreshingly different path with her.

Though I enjoyed the story, I do admit that the movie basically copies the formula of the first two films by having a few characters separated from the others and going on a journey. The movie may as well be called Woody Story as the majority of the cast is sidelined for the film and even Buzz is more of a supporting player. A lot of time is spent on the new characters. Though I can't complain much as they all are pretty entertaining. (Ducky and Bunny (Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele) bring us the funniest joke in the entire series.)

I'd rank this only under number 2. TS4 is a blast and I recommend this to all Toy Story fans.",Pixar's done it again
positive,Toy Story 4,/review/rw4949599/,10,"Toy Story 4 is incredible. It's emotional, fast paced and very funny with incredible animation. Tom Hanks, Annie Potts and Tim Allen give great performances. Tony Hale, Keanu Reeves, Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele are all great and welcome additions to the cast. Overall, a great ending to the franchise.",Incredible and emotional
positive,Toy Story 4,/review/rw4952845/,10,"Toy Story. The animated franchise that has defined me as a filmgoer, filmmaker and writer. I'm turning 24 next month, and Toy Story has damn-near been in my life for all of those years.

The first film was released on Thanksgiving of 1995. I was 4 months old, sleeping in cribs, without any indication of what movies where, or for that matter, any kind of entertainment. But little did I know it would be the first film I would ever watch. The VHS was released the year after, and as I was learning to walk, talk and play, Toy Story played in the background. Something inside me clicked while I watched it. I was enchanted by it's world of make-believe. A world of talking toys. What more could a little kid want? My mother swears that I knew every line of dialogue from the film by the time I was 2 years old. Woody and Buzz where my bread and butter. I had both of them as toys of my own. To me, I was no different than Andy, because Andy was every kid in the world. What Toy Story so astoundingly captured was the bond between a child and his toy. It's unmistakeable and iconic. Needless to say, Toy Story was the family film we never knew we needed, as as a feat of technological genius, one of the finest films ever made.

Toy Story 2 was released 4 years later. By that time, I was old enough to see it in a theater. I'm happy to tell you that I still haven't forgotten the memory of seeing it nearly 20 years ago. My parents took me, and I took my Woody doll with me. We went on a cold and snowy November afternoon. I placed Woody next to me in my seat as the theater lights dimmed to darkness. We loved it. Not to mention, not a single dry eye in that audience during Jessie's ballad, ""When She Loved Me"". But from that experience, I vividly remember leaving Woody behind in the theater, and we had to drive all the way back to retrieve it. Life imitates art.

The gap between Toy Story 2 and 3 was 11 years. That's an eternity to a child. That's your entire elementary and middle school years in the books. I had enough Pixar movies in between to hold me over. By the time Toy Story 3 was released in the summer of 2010, I was already finished with my freshman year of high school. This time, I didn't see it in theaters, and I still don't know the reason. Was I going through a phase? Was I becoming cynical? Did i think I outgrew the material? Lord knows. I watched it when it premiered on cable later that year. That same spirit still stuck with me. The trilogy was complete, the toys left Andy and there was nothing else left to say.. or so we thought.

Toy Story 4 is here. I wouldn't blame you if you feel weary about that. If ever there was a film franchise that shouldn't be milked to death and exploited until every last capital of it has been exhausted, you are looking at it. To even justify a fourth installment, they needed to work hard and get it right. The weekend isn't over and the jury is still out, but i have my verdict. Toy Story 4 is necessary and beautiful. To all fans of the series and any fan of animation, drop what you are doing and see this now. This is worth an hour and change of watching non-streamable content. This is how cinema lives on in the year 2019. For me, as a grown man, this brings it all full circle.

We pick up right where we left off, with the toys belonging to little Bonnie. Still going on grand adventures in the bedroom. It's the first day of kindergarten for Bonnie, and she's too shy and scared to make any friends. Lucky for her, Woody comes to rescue and provides her with supplies to make her own friend. From there, we meet Forky. The product of what happens when toys play God. He's a stick figure made out of a spork, with a serious existential crisis. He keeps throwing himself in the trash. That's right, Forky is suicidal. You couldn't have a Pixar movie without throwing in a little dark social commentary. Bonnie and her parents take a road trip to an amusement park and the toys come with. But Woody gets carried away while guarding the troubled Forky. Woody and Forky get left behind after another episode, and vow to catch up to the park in the morning. As they walk into town, a vintage antique store catches Wood's eye with memorabilia attributed to Bo Peep, the toy that got away long, long ago. The antique store is filled with lost, abandoned toys, including a lonely girl doll named Gabby Gabby who's only friends are creepy ventriloquist dummies who stand upright on their own.. yeah, they are just as creepy as they sound. Forty is captured and Woody escapes the store. He lands in a nearby playground filled with even more abandoned toys, where he is reunited with none other than Bo Peep. It's been a long time since Woody has seen her and she's gotten a 2019 upgrade since. She's a swashbuckling badass now, accompanied with her tiny adorable sidekick, Officer Giggle McDimples. Woody and Bo join forces with Buzz , two smart-ass plush toys (voiced by Key and Peele) and a Canadian daredevil biker (voiced by Keanu Reeves) to save Forky and return him in one piece to Bonnie.

I could gush about this film for hours. First, on a technical level, Toy Story 4 is the most gorgeous looking film of the series. You can see every scratch, blemish and texture on every toy. Gone are the awkward polygons and fuzzy graphics of the Windows 95' generation. I was captivated by everything, from the photo realistic backgrounds to the shining reflective porcelain that gleams off of Bo Peep. It's as sharply funny as any of the Toy Story films, with enough adult asides to keep anyone in the audience from being alienated. It brings the series to an appropriate end that, while wasn't entirely necessary after the third film, concludes the journey of Woody and friends in a totally satisfying way.

Do I envision watching Toy Story 5 at 40 years old? Or 6 at 60? I don't know, but if indeed they are in the works, and if they are as lovely as all 4 previous films have been, I'll warmly invite the opportunities to see more. These movies awesome. To infinity and beyond.",To Infinity and Beyond.
negative,The Grinch,/review/rw4449201/,4,"Took the grandkids to this movie...they didn't think it was very good. It seems like something that was produced for the dollars it could make rather than a story that needed to be told.

The good: it was not very long. The colors are brilliant and visually stimulating. Max was remade with a little more of a fun personality.

The bad: Grinch somehow seemed wrong. I'm not sure if it was the voice, the artistic effects, or just a general un-Grinchiness. The story was a retelling that didn't need to be. The biggest negative is the feeling that this movie is forgettable.

I'm sure I'll never watch it again. I've watched the original about a billion times, and the Jim Carrey version nearly the same.

Bottom line...save your money and rent it later.","OK, but feels unnecessary"
negative,The Grinch,/review/rw4465879/,2,NA,Maybe Christmas perhaps means a little bit more. Lost it's message!
negative,The Grinch,/review/rw4450690/,2,"When the movie ended, I looked over at my family and asked ""did they even sing the grinch song?"" which I was highly anticipating with a fun, new modern edge. my nephew responded with ""it was a remix and not the whole song"" what?! Jim Carey made an entire scene out of it! This movie was a let down. Can they stop remaking movies if they're going to be lazy and unoriginal about it? The Jim Carey one and the original Grinch are way better than this",Did they even sing the song?
negative,The Grinch,/review/rw4448941/,4,"Illumination is a studio known for producing gutless, boring, paint-by-numbers, mass appeal movies that focus more on cute gimmicks and marketing than they do on actual storytelling and character development. If you've seen anything else from Illumination, you practically don't need to see this movie, because you can probably just predict every scene in your head and just about get it right. While The Grinch isn't Illumination's worst, it's still a thoughtless and emotionless product only meant to sell toys and theater tickets before charm and charisma.

Benedict Cumberbatch's Grinch is boring. I do like Cumberbatch and I did think he'd be great to voice the Grinch, but he's terrible in this movie. His voice doesn't match the character whatsoever, and does nothing to bring the character more to life. At least Jim Carrey put energy and emotion into his performance, whereas Cumberbatch sounds like he's disappointed about the small paycheck he's just been given. The Grinch himself is written in a way that pulls all punches and has to cave in to cutesy kids logic instead of a clever way that tells a good story. Instead of making The Grinch actually funny or interesting, they make him the typical 2018 grumpy hipster who's a good guy at heart but just needs his morning coffee. Making him a mostly good character really undermines the climactic payoff of him finally understanding the meaning Christmas towards the end.

Sadly, both the character and the overall movie as a whole share the same problems; it's boring, uninspired, and vanilla. Much like the character, the movie sucks out anything interesting in favor for playing it safe and selling toys. The music is even done by rapper Tyler The Creator, and even as a moderate fan of his work, the music here is terribly uninspired and obviously an attempt to make the film more hip. Most of the jokes are entirely predictable. Actually, the entire movie is predictable. I don't mean we've seen the original movies, I mean the film follows every generic story you'll ever see in a kids movie. The film feels more like it was written by a computer and less like a team of engrossed screenwriters. One of the film's running gags is the ex-popular 'screaming goat' meme...seriously, I thought that meme stopped being funny in 2013.

Truthfully, this film is not the worst thing to come out of Illumination. It may not be a good movie, but at least it doesn't completely bastardize and miseducate its message like The Lorax did, and at least it isn't as excruciatingly for-the-masses as Minions or The Secret Life Of Pets. The Grinch, as well as every single other Illumination Studios movie, is like a cute untamed puppy; it may urinate on your rug and chew up all of your shoes, but it's cute and looks at you with big puppy dog eyes and does silly things, so you don't punish it and let it slide when it really shouldn't be forgiven so easily. When are we as an audience going to stop letting these thoughtless movies slide solely because of their cuteness? Regardless, moms and kids alike will continue to enjoy these movies without the slightest care, simply because it's cute and nothing more.",More or less EXACTLY what one would expect from Illumination's The Grinch.
negative,The Grinch,/review/rw4449747/,1,"They picked the absolute worst voice for the Grinch. Also the Grinch didn't even seem bad.

negative,The Grinch,/review/rw4446867/,5,"I honestly do not get the impressionable casuals who say that any critic who dislikes a movie they like is wrong. Using that logic, YOU'RE wrong for liking it. But that's not true, because it's all subjective. With that out of the way, allow me to explain why I didn't like this movie:

It's dull and boring. It's not interesting, it's only funny in certain places and even then it only resulted in a small smile. If what's advertised to me as a comedy movie isn't that funny to me, I think it's failed as a movie. This could've had the potential to be a pretty decent movie and it's not the first time Illumination has done a Dr Seuss movie. Expectations weren't exactly through the roof, but I expected them to do so much better than this. The animation is pretty good, as expected for Illumination, but it can only dazzle me for about 5 minutes before I realise how dull and uninteresting this movie is.

positive,The Grinch,/review/rw4450813/,10,"There is a reason I don't read critic reviews, and it is because I never ever agree with them. Usually when they say a movie is bad, I like it and vice versa. I like to leave reviews for movies and tv shows because I enjoy them, and I don't care about other people's views. I will give you my honest review as just a regular movie lover. Glad I didn't listen to critics on this film. It was great! A sold out theater. Kids and adults all laughed throughout the film. I went with my husband, sister, brother in law, and my niece and nephew. We all loved it equally. I enjoyed Jim Carey's version but I cannot compare them. I was wondering if I could like this without it having Jim Carey but I truly did. Heart-warming film with a slightly different take on it from the last film. To me, the dog, MAX stole the show! Great animation and effects. 3D is even better. To the people saying there was no storyline...ummm, there was! sheesh. Its about...well...THE GRINCH!! You don't take my advice, its just MY opinion, but I advise everyone to see this. Do not expect an Emmy winner, but it is still a great, warm and cozy holiday film.",Excellent!
negative,The Grinch,/review/rw4446347/,1,"This is another film by illumination animation, a company known for their very cheap animation, generic cookie cutter plots, low brow humor, Pop music, and those annoying minions. Yet despite this list of grievances they are highly successful, because they make lowest common denominator movies anyone between 1 month and 100 years old could watch.

This brings us to the Grinch, a needless remake that no one asked for or wanted. After the Lorax's dreadful adaptation, the quality of this trash should come as no surprise. Yet it represents almost everything wrong with entertainment; it doesn't exist because an artist was inspired to craft a loving adaptation telling a story he/she wanted to tell. It exists because it's a Dr. Seuss property and a Dr. Seuss movie prints the money itself.

Anyway this movie is as lame and as generic as you could possibly imagine. The Grinch is comically sympathetic, but isn't likeable. I'm stunned that the filmmakers managed to suck out all character, nuance, and personality of the Grinch and leave him as a hollow shell who acts like an A**hole. Also the Grinch who should be a foul/gross weirdo looks too clean and basic thanks to the simplicity of the cheap animation.

The townsfolk are either comically evil, ignorant, or innocent. The setting is awful and feels empty, the music sucks, and the pop music REALLY makes your ears bleed in this one folks!

One positive is the color pallet, very Christmas-y and very easy on the eyes. But again the animation is so basic and simplistic that each character looks so bland and unmemorable I can't even remember more than 4 character designs.

Ultimately the quality doesn't matter (the studio knows this, which is why they sold this movie out to any company that would advertise it), people will see this and it'll make over $500 million at least. If somehow you like illumination animation movies, you'll like this one. if you don't then you'll hate this.","One word, LAME"

I was enchanted by this movie from the moment it started. It was a fun animated movie, with gorgeous animation, a lot of heart, and even some humor. The 90 minute run-time makes the movie fly by.

And the Grinch is evil but not scary. This has been ridiculed, but I like that the movie was trying to make it more comfortable for the little ones.

The ending, even though I knew it was coming, was very uplifting. The Grinch's heart grew 3 times bigger, but guess what? So did mine!

And it doesn't have the terrible jokes and weird feeling of the Jim Carrey version...","My fiancé, who is the biggest Grinch of them all, loved this move"
negative,The Grinch,/review/rw4501100/,2,"... and for anybody not alive 53 years ago, he was the voice of the original animated Grinch.

I am a very big fan of the Grinch, both the original and the Jim Carrey version, and if you're expecting those qualities in the slightest you will be very disappointed. First off the Grinch is not even that mean. He loves his dog Max and is overly affectionate, constantly telling him ""You can do it Max, believe in yourself!"" It is 2018 so animal cruelty is out. This is like ""baby Grinch"" or something with that high-pitched millennial voice. Boris Karloff also has such a sinister sounding voice, something that works perfect for the Grinch character. I can't say that Benedict Cumberbatch has that same quality.

Secondly they didn't even stick to the script of the classic Grinch we all grew up with. In this film, Cindy Lou is the older child of three with a overworked single mother whose only wish is that her mother had it way easier. Because in this Grinch movie Betty Lou is a strong independent woman and she needs no man. Finally the music of the movie was completely awful, not having one original song. Even after getting through the whole awful movie, you think to yourself - maybe just maybe I can hear one original ""You're a mean one"" at the credits .No, it's a weird rap song. So the only thing to do is run out of the movie theater and write this one off as a waste of money and, more importantly, time. If you're a Grinch fan don't, DON'T see this movie. The only thing you'll be doing is telling yourself ""this couldn't get any worse"", then be shocked as it gradually hits rock bottom.

I'll give it a three for at least getting the technical aspects of the movie correct. And even then I pull it down one star because technical aspects are part of the Star War films, but should not be part of The Grinch. The simplicity of the original Chuck Jones illustrations of the 1966 cartoon is one of my favorite aspects of the original. Who needs a complicated background? Just make the background blue, or yellow, or pink, etc. Everything these days is CGI'd to death, to the point where the CGI isn't even impressive anymore, it's just boring.",The implementation of this film is scarier than Boris Karloff!...

This movie is an easy classic that will be in our Christmas movie rotation every year. It's so nice to see a take on the story that sticks pretty close to the original without doing what kids movies do so often these days - create over the top sad and heartbreaking back stories.

positive,Aladdin,/review/rw1079397/,10,"I grew up watching this film and along with Beauty and the Beast and Cinderella it is one of my favourite Disney films. I love it! Robin Williams is so good in it. He's hilarious. This film isn't just for kids but for the whole family. I think I was about 5 when I first saw it and at 14 I still watch it and so do my parents. I haven't seen the sequels because I heard that Robin Williams wasn't in them and decided that they wouldn't be as good without him. He was made for the part. The songs are amazing. I love singing along to ""A Whole new World"". I'm hoping to get the soundtrack soon. I also love the film because I have the same name as the princess in it! I would definitely recommend it to everyone. You're never too old to watch a classic Disney film.",This film is so good!
positive,Aladdin,/review/rw0950861/,9,"This movie has three elements that are important for an animated Disney movie: Great songs, a good villain and a great sidekick.

The songs and music in general are just great and very memorable. Jafar is a great villain mainly because he is voiced by Jonathan Freeman who has got a good and scary voice. But what is maybe the best element of the movie is Robin Williams as the blue genie. The blue genie is like a jokemachine that once it is started can't stop again and keeps you laughing.

The story is good and the pace is high. ""Aladdin"" is not too short and it's not too long, it's not too immature and it's not too mature, it's a perfect movie for the entire family with a wonderful love story (even though it's no ""Beauty and the Beast"") and good animations with some good looking early computer effects.

9/10","Great songs and a good villain make ""Aladdin"" a Disney classic."
positive,Aladdin,/review/rw2534639/,10,"I will never forget the first time I watched ""Aladdin"", I was with a group of friends waiting in the airport for the plane that would take us from Orlando to Paris at the time when ""Aladdin"" was the 'big thing' in the USA while some previews of ""The Lion King"" were starting to screen. ""Aladdin"" will forever be associated to that wonderful week I spent in Disneyland, and it's only fitting if the movie is my favorite Disney film, slightly edging-out ""The Jungle Book"".

I know I can get all rational in this review, analyzing what makes ""Aladdin"" such an appealing film and using the expected words of 'Disney Renaissance' and a comparison with the glorious Best Picture nominee predecessor. I can also talk about the animation, the music, the extraordinary multi-vocal performance of Robin Williams as Genie but I don't feel like getting rational. I love the film for personal reasons that are essentially due to the excellent timing of this film in its penetration of my pre-adolescent life. ""Aladdin"" took a forever cherished place as one of the last treasures that enriched my childhood even playing a pivotal role in the way I would start enjoying cartoons.

""Kid's day in the USA!"" was the motto of the week that was celebrating the 65th birthday of Mickey Mouse, and for a kid who never traveled outside his country, going to Disneyland was the most unexpected destination, the most extraordinary trip I would never have dared to dream of. This is when I discovered ""Aladdin"", through the 'Prince Ali' fanfare endlessly performed during the parades, through the films' images aired on TV; something was strangely attracting me to the film. And I guess the fact that I knew the story helped a lot: I grew up with a French cartoon from 1969, titled 'Aladin and the Magic Lamp' recorded in an 80's videocassette, a movie I can recite (and sing) by heart, and there was also an obscure Manga 'Aladdin' film we watched at school before the summer holidays.

Needless to say I was already familiar with the story, and seeing it translated into Disney language was something I was excited to see. Would they talk about Aladdin's deceased father Mustapha? Would he live with his mother? What kind of roles would Genie play? Well one thing matters apart from these questions: I knew the story and I could understand the film even if I didn't speak English at that time  it wouldn't have helped me anyway because the airport was very noisy, so I just sat on my luggage, eating some candies, and I could understand who was who and what was everyone's scheme: obviously, Aladdin wanted to be a prince to marry the princess and Jafar to marry the princess to become the prince, and between them, the Genie would come to fulfill their dreams. So, I saw the film and I loved it.

And for one year, before I would see it again, the music of 'Pince Ali' and 'A Whole New World' was the musical remembrance of that magical week in Disney World. And when I saw it again, it took another dimension: I finally understood the subtleties of the stories, I learned all the songs after repetitive viewings, and for months and months, I was transported by the 'Prince Ali' parade and its climactic conclusion and the romantic 'A Whole New World' and its beautiful opening, when Jasmine jumps on the carpet and the zoomed-out Rajah looks smaller and smaller, watching from the balcony. I saw the film so many times during my pre-teen years that I would never forget the first sensations it immersed me into, with an unexpected awkward one.

I must confess that Jasmine was one of my first movie crushes and my idea of the ideal woman as a kid, I don't know why but the way she looked during the 'love at first sight moment' hypnotized me and the moment where I always melt occurs in the carpet ride, when Aladdin gives her the apple, when you understand that she understood who the Prince Ali is, there are no words to describe how incredibly sexy she looks at that very moment. The crush didn't last of course, and as I grew older and was disappointed with the 'Return of Jafar' sequel and the TV series, my interest for ""Aladdin"" declined and it was reduced to 'kid's stuff I used to like'.

And then 10 years later, as a student, I saw the film again on my computer, eating a pizza, and something magical happened when the 'Whole New World' music started during the closing credits, my heart was inundated by a nostalgic torrent, so immense that I couldn't stop crying because it reminded me of the privileged place the movie occupied once in my heart. The magic was back, and whenever I was spending a good time with friends, we were having fun listening to these old Disney songs, and the clip of 'A Whole New World' was a must-see  and how glad I was to discover that I wasn't the only one who 'liked' Jasmine.

I feel so concerned by this film and so deeply attached to it, that I don't want to spoil this review with critical or ecstatic reviews, the film is just thrilling, romantic, adventurous, and features certainly the greatest cast of supporting characters without it being the counterpart of a dull hero or heroine, there's not a single minute of the film that seems pointless and wasted and certainly not with a character like Genie. That's the best I could do to rationally 'explain' my love for ""Aladdin"".

But maybe because loving a film can also depend on external factors that influence your judgment, in the case of ""Aladdin"", everything contributed to make this my favorite Disney film ... for sentimental reasons yes, but who ever said they were wrong?",Forever a favorite of mine ...
positive,Aladdin,/review/rw1263157/,10,"Simply a classic. The movie Aladdin is hilariously told with many many MANY funny moments. The genie his an all-time high in this classic film about a street rat and a princess. A great movie for young kids, but even adults will love the wonderfully amusing lines throughout the story. 

The songs in the movie are well-known and catchy. I even had a guy since one of them to a girl at a school dance! Everyone recognizes them, and it is our duty to make sure the next generations continues to appreciate such a wonderful work of art.

A great movie for the entire family to sit down and watch together, it's good sometimes to take a blast to the past and enjoy some of those good ol' movies.",Great movie!
positive,Aladdin,/review/rw0302713/,10,"I did not care to see this movie, but I was such a big Robin Williams that I rented it long after it stopped playing in the theaters. From the first few scenes I was spellbound by the voices and the script.I can still mimmick nearly all of the Genie's themes as well as see myself play Aladdin in a live action version of this movie with Paula Abdul as Jasmine and John De Lancie as Jafar. Jasmine in this movie has the same sexual innocence as Ariel the Little Mermaid and Krysta of Fern Gully. The songs are infectious, especially ""Friend Like Me"" and ""A Whole New World."" The whole movie is one big roller coaster ride augmented by the raucous wit of Robin Williams and his own talent for mimmicry and improvisation. Ten Stars way up!",Vintage Robin Williams
positive,Aladdin,/review/rw1571053/,10,"I can think of three quick reasons why this has remained one of the best animated movies ever: 1 - Very good, very catchy songs that still sound good 15 years later; 2 - excellent, colorful visuals; 3 - the unique humor of Robin Williams, who seems to spout a joke-a- second. In fact, you have to pay close attention to hear Williams' lines because they come so fast and furious. Actually, at times they are too fast. You hardly have time to laugh or digest what he just said when another line hits you. Williams' genie character doesn't appear on screen until after the first third of the film is over.

Without all those jokes - and the great visuals that go with those gags (things popping up like Saturday morning cartoons), this would just be a routine Disney animated film. Part of the normal Disney fare includes a hero who is a good guy but a liar and a heroine who is the typical wasp-waisted beauty who is rebellious against the rules of the day. The villain is an ""Oil Can Harry"" mustached dastardly employee of the king who desires king-like powers. His scenes, however, are tempered with humor thanks to his New York City-sounding obnoxious parrot, who provides most of the movie's slapstick humor.

Maybe the best attribute of this film is simply how fast it moves, meaning it's very, very entertaining.","Robin Williams,  Great Songs Make This One Of The Best Animated Films Ever"
positive,Aladdin,/review/rw1266161/,8,"Magic, adventures, laughs, love... This film has everything mixed, and the result is quite good! The film is about the classic tale of ""Aladdin and the magic lamp"", so the story is well known by everybody. Despite it is for children, the quality of the characters is very good, the story, though predictable and typical, results interesting and, which is more important, it males us to spend a good hour and a half. The songs (typical in Disney) never are boring, and are surprisingly well mixed with images. In addition, action scenes are well ended and most characters are very charismatic. Aladdin is sympathetic form the beginning and most secondary characters are simply perfect. The ""acting"" of the Genius is superb in his strangeness and absurd, and Yafar is well remembered as one of the ""best"" bad ones of the history of cinema. It exhales an immense aura of evilness hardly ever seen in a movie... To sum up, one of the best (maybe the best) Disney film made, which everything to have a nice afternoon with your children or just spending a nice time laughing and remembering when you were a child.",Fantastic!
positive,Aladdin,/review/rw0302703/,7,"I think this is one of the funniest films that Disney has ever done. This is due entirely to Robin William's brilliant voice of the Genie. He is wonderful in this role. I think the animation is pretty fair although I dislike the ""generic"" people that Disney's shop is putting out these days. They all share the same basic facial structure and eyes, so there is not much difference between any of the characters. It's not like Sleepy, Doc and Sneezy, who all looked very different. Still, this is a great and funny film. It is totally clean and not very violent so it is appropriate for every member of the family. Give this one a try and you'll have a great time watching it!",Hilarious
positive,Aladdin,/review/rw1699755/,8,"The 31st animated Disney classic is one of Disney's best known movies. It also takes us to a whole new world, a new fantastic point of view. This one takes place in Saudi Arabia. I've always liked this movie.

""Aladdin"" is very entertaining and great fun. It is hilarious, creative, imaginative and romantic. It isn't a faultless movie, but it's a little difficult not to like it.

I'll start by talking about the characters. The blue Genie is, without a doubt, the most amusing, hilarious, imaginative and genial Genie ever created. Robin Williams steals the show as the Genie's voice. With his incredible talent to do voices, he's hilariously awesome and fantastic as the Genie's voice (and also as the voice of the enigmatic merchant that appears at the beginning, who happens to be an interesting character).

Iago is the funniest character of this movie, along with the Genie. Nobody better than Gilbert Gottfried to voice the sarcastic parrot. Iago is simply hilarious! He's rude, grumpy, sarcastic, hungry for power, malicious, obnoxious and foul-tempered. He has an irritating voice but in a funny way, as well as a great talent to perfectly mimic other characters's voices. However, deep down inside he has a heart. I also love his hate for crackers. I don't see why does he hates crackers so much, but that also makes him so funny! Besides, a parrot with teeth?? lol!

Jafar is a great villain. Although often calm and humorous (for example, he keeps calling ""Prince Abooboo"" to ""Prince Ali""), he also represents the worst and most ambitious kind of villain and he is one of the most dangerous Disney villains. And he does possess a snake-like tone of voice sometimes.

Princess Jasmine, what can I say? Have you ever seen a more beautiful Disney princess? She's just gorgeous! Despite her strong and challenging personality, I like her anyway.

The Sultan is a funny dude. The Magic Carpet is lovable, one of my favorite characters from the movie. Aladdin himself is a nice guy, poor but kind-hearted (although dishonest, immature and selfish sometimes).

Abu is funny mostly because of his vocal sounds, very Donald Duck-like. The Cave of Wonders is an amazing character. It is a giant tiger's head with an absolutely fantastic and brutal deep-throat voice.

""Aladdin"" is a festival of magic, special effects, bombastic humor and jokes.

By the way, I absolutely love the song ""A Whole New World"". The version sung by Aladdin and Jasmine is great, but the original version of Peabo Bryson and Regina Belle is better, deeper and more romantic and classic. It's a very romantic and joyful song, which is always a pleasure to listen. ""Arabian Nights"" is a nice song as well...

I'd only wish that ""Aladdin"" hadn't become a victim of its own success. It inspired 2 sequels and several stories with these characters.

This should definitely be on Top 250.",A whole new world. A new fantastic point of view...
NA,Aladdin,/review/rw0302681/,NA,"This movie was the biggest film of '92, and it's easy to see why-a lotta fun, as a terrific Robin Williams performance carries it to heights it otherwise would not have gone to. Great animation, fine songs, a decent plot--what is there not to like? I will admit some of the Arab characters seemed to be stereotyped-but no more so than in Mulan or Tarzan or whatever; animation seems to stereotype Everything.

positive,Aladdin,/review/rw1103893/,8,"Just watched this recently, on the new-and-improved DVD which features a restored print, and it looks spectacular.

I have a tiny issue with the fact that the most recent VHS and DVD prints of the movie have bowed to pressure from activist groups and altered a line in the opening song. The original line was, ""...where they cut if your ear if they don't like your face/It's barbaric, but hey, it's home."" The revised line reads, ""...where the land is immense and the heat is intense/It's barbaric, but hey, it's home."" Protesters claimed the original line perpetuated a negative stereotype of Arab countries and peoples. But...but...but marketplaces and cities in Arabian countries still cut the hands off convicted thieves. And there's even a scene in the film which threatens to relieve the princess of an appendage.

But the energy and story will keep you entertained. The usual be yourself message at the end can be found just about anywhere, but I'm sure you won't mind.

positive,Aladdin,/review/rw0302712/,7,"This movie is one of the better Disney animated films in recent years. Cute story, fun, light, entertaining and a catchy score to boot this is actually quite tolerable. 7/10",IMHO
positive,Aladdin,/review/rw3034601/,7,"""Aladdin"" is brought to us by the same team who made ""The Little Mermaid."" So, of course, this movie leaves me a little baffled. There are some things I like and some things I don't.

ANIMATION: The best thing about the animation is the color of the look of Arabia. I didn't see this movie until last December; before I saw it, I heard about how great the colors and the lights were. Everything pops, it's bright, and it's great.

SONGS/MUSIC: Sadly, this was the last Disney film to have Howard Ashman's work in it; he passed away before ""Beauty and the Beast"" was completed. Fortunately, he left us some really good songs in this movie, along with Alan Menken and Tim Rice. Not every song in this film is memorable, but they almost are. Of course everyone knows and loves ""A Whole New World,"" which both does sound nice and contributes greatly to the movie; we really see our main characters fall in love. My favorite song is ""Friend Like Me."" Not only are the lyrics, music, and animation great, but Robin Williams gets just as animated as the animation.

ROMANCE: I mentioned our main characters' romance a bit earlier, and, again, you believe they're in love. Though, have you noticed this is the same romance we had in ""The Little Mermaid?"" The protagonist sees their romantic interest and falls in love. They save their life and admires them, but the two of them are kept apart for some reason. Then our protagonist has to take on a new form/identity to get their romantic interest to fall in love with them, the villain eventually tests their relationship, but they wind up being together again in the end...Huh. I don't see the downside in disliking their relationship, though. It still seems genuine. At least Aladdin has more time with Jasmine before he becomes a prince than Ariel did with Eric before she became human.

CHARACTERS: Most of the characters are OK. Aladdin, Jasmine, and the Sultan are OK. Iago and the Magic Carpet are a little annoying, but they're not that bad. In my opinion, the Genie - again, voiced by Robin Williams - is the best character! When I was watching this last December I said to myself, ""This film is OK, but why was it a hit during the Disney Renaissance?"" Then the Genie came on the screen. He is the most entertaining thing in this movie! Robin Williams puts so much energy and passion in playing this role. I like that the Genie isn't just a funny, pop-culture referencing character; he actually has development to him. That makes him both likable and relatable. I don't like Abu, I think he's too annoying and too selfish. The character I can't figure out is the villain, Jafar. People have said he's one of the greatest Disney villains...Really? I'm glad you see that, but I don't. To me, he's not consistent. Based on what I saw of Jafar in the beginning of the movie, I didn't expect him to be the type who would dress as a crazy old man or have witty remarks with a parrot. That's not to say that Jafar can't be funny, but did you really think the guy we saw in the beginning of the movie would speak as he did throughout the movie? Not only that, but his power is weak! Did you notice the Sultan did not fall under Jafar's spell when he tried to hypnotize him before the ""Prince Ali"" number? Why? What made him come out the spell so easily? He did it TWICE! Jafar's victims can decide when they'll be hypnotize? And why is his evilness so obvious, yet so hidden from everyone else? Out of all the times he's hypnotized the Sultan, NO ONE NOTICED?! Aladdin realized something was wrong the first time he saw it happen - no one else in the palace ever saw it?!

STORY: The story is OK, I guess. One thing bothered me, though: in the beginning, Jasmine tells the Sultan she doesn't want to be forced to be married, she wants to marry for love (Blah, blah, blah, we've heard it before). At the end of the movie when Aladdin and Jasmine come together, the Sultan decides to let them marry. ""Am I Sultan, or am I Sultan,"" he asks. ""From this day forth, the Princess will marry whomever she deems worthy."" WHY IN THE CRUD DIDN'T HE DO THAT BEFORE!??! He could have stopped this whole thing from happening...MUCH LIKE ARIEL IN ""The Little Mermaid!!!"" Gosh! What's up with the Clements/Musker team?

CONCLUSION: I couldn't go into too much detail, but you get the gist of it. There are some things I really like, some things I'm indifferent to, and some things I don't like. Overall, I still like this movie, though. I surprisingly find myself attracted to how entertaining this movie is, even the weird Jafar moments. I like it, and hopefully you will too.

positive,Aladdin,/review/rw1485389/,10,"This one is another example of the Disney guys' ability of traducing even the darkest stories to the screen. Aladdin is originally one of those dark stories with complicated language and plot, but directors Clements and Musker look beyond the obstacle and, once again, produce a great animated movie for children and adults. This film is wonderful. From the beginning, when a mysterious merchant sings one of the greatest ""onde upon a time"" songs ever, passing from the romantic moment, you are so fascinated with colors, camera movements and great voices, you can't take you eyes off of the screen. Incredible characters, a strong villain, good songs and breath-taking soundtrack and scenes, it has everything a Disney classic needs to be great. And this great would not be so great if Robin Williams wasn't the genie. What a talented guy. Jonathan Freeman as Jafar is not far behind, he helps the making of the best Disney villain. The characters animation is soft and beautiful, uninterested, the way the directors like. No matter the climax concludes with a (kind of) inexpressive phrase, it's only a minimum detail, and minimum details is for Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale (Beauty and the Beast), who seem to only care about that. Clements and Musker are a lot of steps ahead because they are the ones who inherited Walt Disney's magic. Let's hope they stay active for a good time.",Disney's second best

Unfortunately the evil Jafar plans on using the genie to his own will and wreaks havoc on Aladdin's newly-found life (he wishes to become a sultan in the hopes of earning the love of his life, Princess Jasmine).

This is simply a wonderful story with bold animation and a truly terrific vocal performance by Robin Williams. It's the movie's adult humor -- such as the Ah-nuld and Woody Allen impersonations done by Williams -- that make it equally enjoyable for all ages. When this was released in 1992 I was fascinated and used to watch it all the time; now, as an adult, I still enjoy the film for many different reasons, while still managing to appreciate the utter joy of the story.

Yes, it's a bit politically correct with Princess Jasmine's strong will against her father and the representation of certain ""careful stereotypes"" (Disney is careful not to come across as racist and in the process cast Americans to do the voices!) but I like it this way. Without Williams the film would be a total bore, to be honest. With him, it's one of the greatest films ever made, which is something I thought I'd never write.
